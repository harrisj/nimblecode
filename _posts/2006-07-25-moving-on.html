<p>Eight years. That&#8217;s how long I have worked at Alacra, starting fresh
out of school in the heady days of the first web boom. Eight years is
an astounding length of time to most programmers, conditioned to a
revolving door approach to employment, and it is a testament to what
an interesting and nurturing place Alacra is that I&#8217;ve been here this
long. Furthermore, I&#8217;m hardly an anomaly among the developers, most of
whom have been here well over five years too. It&#8217;s a place where
people like to stay, and it feels more like a family than an office
sometimes. But I am now leaving. Alacra&#8217;s been my only post-college
job, and it&#8217;s simply time for me to try something new.</p>


	<p>Next week, I will start working at <a href="http://www.nytdigital.com/">New York Times
Digital</a>. Yes, that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York
Times</a> that is delivered to about 1.5 million readers
in dead tree form. That number might seem impressive in itself, but
<strong>50 times that number</strong> of users read the online web version, meaning I
will be working on apparently <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2006/05/the_leading_glo.html">the most popular online news site in the
world</a>. Yow. No
pressure there. Seriously though, I am looking forward to the
challenges and I hope to learn a lot of new skills on the job. The <a href="http://newyorktimesbuilding.com/">new office building</a>
will also be pretty sweet when it opens.</p>


	<p>Still, the change is weird. It&#8217;s definitely been a strange two weeks
in this liminal zone, and I am filled with conflicting emotions. I am
sad about leaving all my colleagues at Alacra, but enthusiastic about the
opportunities ahead. It&#8217;s an exciting time.</p>
