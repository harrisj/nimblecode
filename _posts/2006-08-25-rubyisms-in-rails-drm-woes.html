<p>Sorry for the silence. I was on vacation in Alaska recently, so I&#8217;ve not really been in the blogging mood. But here is a short note and plea for understanding.</p>


	<p>Early reviews (okay, <em>review</em> as I&#8217;ve only had one; let me know if you&#8217;ve written one or want to do a review) of the ebook have been <a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/suggestedreading/gr/rubyisms_rails.htm">encouragingly favorable</a>, but the biggest complaints I&#8217;ve gotten so far have been about the <span class="caps">DRM</span>. I have spoken to my publisher and she&#8217;s informed me this was a mistake that was corrected after the first day, and if you&#8217;ve been stung with a <span class="caps">DRM</span>-afflicted version, we will provide you with a <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free replacement. Furthermore, <strong>no books in the Ruby Shortcut series will have <span class="caps">DRM</span>.</strong></p>


	<p>The best way to do this would be to <a href="mailto:harrisj@schizopolis.net?subject=Rubyisms DRM Victim Seeks Replacement">mail me directly</a> and I will pass along your email address to my publisher to send you a replacement copy. My email address is <strong>harrisj</strong> @ <strong>schizopolis.net</strong>. It&#8217;s probably easier to just click that mailto link above though.</p>


	<p>Sorry for the problems. This is a new direction for them and me, and I guess we still had a few kinks to work out. Thanks for your patience.</p>
