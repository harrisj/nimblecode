Steps I have taken trying to download the updated VPN client for Cisco firewalls

<ol>
<li>Click on link to download from VersionTrackers, gets login form</li>
<li>Fills out a 4-page registration form to get an account</li>
<li>Waits 20 minutes for an email confirming the account to arrive</li>
<li>Click on activation link to activate. Try to search for VPN software. Search functionality is awful</li>
<li>Go back to original link, enter username &amp; password; informed that account not found</li>
<li>Click on activation link again. Login successfully I think, but taken to Cisco front page where there is no indication I've logged in.</li>
<li>Find an indication I am apparently logged in with a guest status and need to provide more information to get access but no indication of what that information is.</li>
<li>Find the location for Cisco VPN software in the tree navigation finally. Then click on a link to Downloads (aha!) only to be told "You are either not logged in, or you are currently visiting this page with public or guest access."
</li></ol>

And this is where I give up briefly because I have real work to do. Honestly, can anybody explain why Cisco's website sucks so horribly? I know there might be export controls for some of their software, but I just want to get an update for their VPN software for my operating system, an update that is late considering they've had months to work on it, and their stupid website keeps getting in the way of what I want to do.
