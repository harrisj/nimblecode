Supergreg has created a great but possibly short-lived combination of competing web-services, combining Yahoo's <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/05/subscribe_to_yo_1.html">Traffic Conditions RSS</a> with <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> to make the best traffic conditions mapper I've seen yet. See if before it goes away (a cease and desist is probably on its way now) at <a href="http://supergreg.hopto.org/google-yahoo/">Supergreg's Site</a>.
