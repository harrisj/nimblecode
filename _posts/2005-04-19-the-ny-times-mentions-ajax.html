Congratulations, AJAX! As a piece of techno-jargon, you've really arrived. Buried deep within the article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/business/yourmoney/17techno.html">An Update on Stuff That's Cool (Like Google's Photo Maps)</a>, there's the quote

<blockquote>The real importance of Google's map and satellite program, however, is not its impressive exterior but the novel technology, known as Ajax, that lies beneath. About that, and its implications for Google and other companies, there will be more to say in a future column.</blockquote>

Oh, James Fallows, you're such a tease! Still, it's nice to see AJAX getting the attention. And downright startling to see all the AJAX targeted AdSense entries on the right. For a recently coined term, this really has legs. Now to see if the hype and the interest leads to better websites too.
