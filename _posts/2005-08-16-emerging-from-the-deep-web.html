<p>After a long period of working in relative obscurity to the web at large, my employer <a href="http://www.alacra.com/">Alacra</a> has now launched a store to sell some of the premium content to the public. Gentlemen, I present to you (in Beta form), <a href="http://www.alacrastore.com/">Alacra Store</a></p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a very interesting time for us here at Alacra. Although we are a small company compared to the media behemoths that surround us (ie, Thomson, Lexis, etc.), we have always managed to thrive by delivering agile and powerful solutions to our customers and making their happiness our #1 priority. And although I can&#8217;t really talk about it, there are great things afoot. For more analysis, see the always excellent <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/08/the_alacra_stor.html">Fred Wilson</a>. I particularly like it when he says</p>


<blockquote>
I have been involved with a lot of companies over the years, but very few, if any, are as loved by their customers and are as unknown to the rest of the world as Alacra.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But that may change shortly. Hopefully not the â€œloved by their customersâ€? part. I am talking about the â€œunknown to the rest of the worldâ€? part.</blockquote>

	<p>That&#8217;s us. And if there is one thing I love even more than the new technologies we will be using with the store, it&#8217;s the fact that I can finally show people the stuff <span class="caps">I  </span>(and my able colleagues) have been working on.</p>
