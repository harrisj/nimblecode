<p>Posting will be light, my nonexistant readers for the next week. I am off to <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/200048">Cape Cod</a> to enjoy the fine weather and calm beaches before September starts up. I hope to spend most of the time away from the computer too. So I will see you when I get back, and be sure to enjoy the last of summer and eat more ice cream.</p>
