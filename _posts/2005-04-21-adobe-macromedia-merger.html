I am very busy these next few days, so I don't really have much to add to the existing commentary on this merger out there, but if you haven't seen it already, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/04/adobe_translation">Daring Fireball's translation of the Adobe merger press release</a> is a great analysis of the reality of the deal. I particularly like this translation of the release's original mention of "the complementary nature of Acrobat and Flash.":

<blockquote>Where by "complementary" we mean "the two leading technologies that irritate people when theyâ€™re used in lieu of regular web pages." Note that weâ€™re using PDF to serve this very FAQ â€” in our synergistic future, perhaps weâ€™ll serve our FAQs in a hybrid PDF/Flash format. One can dream.</blockquote>

Indeed, one can. And then hope to wake up...
