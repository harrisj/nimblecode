<p>For the past 5 years, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> has graced with an annual roundup article titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2005/12/11/magazine/index.html">The Year In Ideas</a>. The issue actually came out last week, but it&#8217;s a sign of my recent workload &#8211; and the excessive number of holiday parties I had to attend &#8211; that I only read it on the commute into work today.</p>


	<p>It actually was rather boring. Not because of the ideas themselves, but because I had actually read many of them before on various blogs and other geeky websites (<em>Sometimes, I long for a service like &#8220;del.icio.us&#8221; for feed subscriptions just so I can share how hip the feeds I read are)</em>. I am not an information omnivore by any means, but it was apparent that I was cued into some of the same idea sources as the editors of the New York Times. Which led to an idea of my own. Since the New York Times has declared its Year In Ideas issue to be an annual tradition, I&#8217;m going to start my own personal tradition of tabulating my personal New York Times Year In Ideas Hipness score (or <span class="caps">NYTYIIH</span> for short). The methodology is simple. Look at every idea listed and if you had heard of it before reading in the Times, give yourself a point. Okay, let&#8217;s get started then.</p>


	<p>The following table lists the titles of the ideas in the 2005 Year in Ideas issue with bold ones being ideas I had encountered before. I know some of the titles are cryptic, but you can take that up with the New York Times editors and not me.</p>

	<p>So, what is my final score? 51 out of 78, which gives me <span class="caps">NYTYIIH</span> score of 65.38%! I&#8217;m quite pleased with myself this year; since I have just started, I can unabashedly call this year&#8217;s score my personal best. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2005/12/11/magazine/index.html">Can you beat me?</a></p>
