One of my perennial complaints about the whole "future of journalism" topic is that it seems to be predominated less by people who actually <em>create</em> things and more by people who either come up with trivial ideas that they proclaim will save journalism and those who instead to observe from a remove and discuss what <em>it</em> all means (no, I'm not naming names). Many conferences leave me similarly unenthused. <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/sxsw/on/journalism/">Here are the journalism panels for SXSW this year.</a> And every other week there is another panel on what Wikileaks means for journalism, but <a href="http://meetupnyc.hackshackers.com/events/16183374/">rarely any on how people have used it for journalism.</a> (<em>tasteless self-promotion there</em>).

Which is why I find myself strangely excited to be attending the <a href="http://data.nicar.org/conference/raleigh2011">2011 Computer Assisted Reporting</a> conference this year. For those of you unfamiliar with the term, Computer Assisted Reporting is what database/web journalism was called before it got cool (and before they could put data on the web). And this year there seem to be a surprisingly large number of data journalists I know -- but have never met -- attending. I suppose there will be a little culture clash between the young punks and the old guard, but I also know it'll be a conference full of people discussing <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/car/schedule/">how to do things</a>, and that is what makes me excited.

<em>Are you going to be at the CAR Conference too? If so, please say hi.</em>
