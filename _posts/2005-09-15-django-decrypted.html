<p>It&#8217;s an interesting time for web development. Not only is <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> steaming along towards version 1.0, but it&#8217;s spurring the development of other web frameworks in the <span class="caps">MVC</span> mold.</p>


	<p>As a case in point, consider <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, a new web framework written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Now, I have been dabbling in Ruby on Rails, but I don&#8217;t really have the time to learn Python yet sadly, and I can&#8217;t really figure out which would be better to do a site from scratch in. What is a developer to do?</p>


	<p>Thankfully, fellow blogger <a href="http://www.jvoorhis.com/">Jeremy Voorhis</a> has stepped into the gap. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, be sure to check out his entries on <a href="http://www.jvoorhis.com/articles/category/django">working with Django</a> on his blog.</p>


	<p>Incidentally, there does not seem to be much ire or competition against relative newcomer Django by the Rails people. In truth, there never should be. It&#8217;s a big enough web for both, and I think there are some things that each framework can learn from each other (Django could benefit from something like ActiveRecord, Rails would be improved if it had Django&#8217;s mechanism for specifying database schema). Such situations are rare in the computing world (see the eternal flames of emacs vs. vi, windows vs. mac, compiled vs. scripting, typed languages vs. dynamic typing, etc.), which makes such cooperation all the more remarkable.</p>
