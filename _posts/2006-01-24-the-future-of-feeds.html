<p>Earlier this year, I made a <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/lists/6TeddyWayneandGregWayne.html">New Year&#8217;s Resolution</a> to write more postings to the blog, but I have failed abjectly at that so far sadly. January is sadly a busy month for me, and I usually don&#8217;t feel like coming home after a long day to stare at a computer screen some more. But occaisionally inspiration strikes, and I feel like sharing some thoughts I have about the future of Syndication via <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Atom feeds in the next few years.</p>


	<p>I have to agree with my company&#8217;s <span class="caps">CEO </span><a href="http://www.alacrablog.com/">Steve Goldstein</a> when he says that <a href="http://www.alacrablog.com/alacrablog/2006/01/trends_in_the_i.html">increasing <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom adoption will be one of the big trends in the information industry in 2006</a>. Speculating wildly, I think that 2006 will be <strong>The Year of <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Atom</strong>. And so, I&#8217;m going to make a few bold predictions of my own about the state of syndication and the software industry. To avoid spending even longer without posting to the blog, I have decided to not bother with <em>research</em>, so if something I have predicted has actually <em>happened</em> already, be sure to make a snarky comment about it  to me below. Thanks. And now here are big things I see happening in the next year or so:</p>


	<p><strong>Mainstream Feed Adoption</strong> &#8211; Currently, most of the sites producing feeds are still blogs and news sites â€“- those for whom the article paradigm within feeds is a natural fit. However, non-newsy sites like <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> have earned a lot of buzz not just for their front-end interfaces but for their innovative and pervasive use of feeds <em>everywhere</em> and using syndication for non-article content. But this is still under the radar of the typical Internet user for now. I think this will change this year. I expect a major online site to follow suit this year and provide syndication of their data in a similar fashion. For instance, I would not be surprised if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> began to offer feeds for user wishlists or upcoming recommendations or music alerts. That would rock.</p>


	<p><strong>More People Will Embrace <span class="caps">RSS</span>, But Still Not Know It</strong> &#8211; A survey from last year by Yahoo! revealed that <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/06/01/01/1424220.shtml?tid=126">only 4% of Internet users knew what <span class="caps">RSS</span> was</a>, but this will most certainly change. The name is obviously somewhat to blame (there&#8217;s a joke that if it were called SpeedFeed more people would use it), but I think it&#8217;s not the real problem. In truth, most people just don&#8217;t care. For your typical web user, the Web is a toy more than a place to siphon information from; they are therefore not exactly vexed enough by the slowness of visiting sites to want to setup an aggregator. Instead, I think some different killer app beyond mere aggregation will be the only thing to make most people want to use <span class="caps">RSS</span>. I have no idea what that app might be, but I&#8217;m sure one of you could think of something awesome.</p>


	<p><strong>RSS Is A Terrible Business Though</strong> &#8211; For companies that produce or sell content, <span class="caps">RSS</span> will be a good fit, providing additional ways for users to access the site and contributing a small boost in sales or page visits. But companies in the <span class="caps">RSS</span> software business (particularly online aggregators) will have a terrible time. There are just very few barriers to entry for competitors, and the whole <em>we&#8217;ll make money through advertising</em> model seems so very pre-boom to me. That said, there are still some promising markets for companies doing <span class="caps">RSS</span> software. Software that allows filters or other mechanisms for mitigating information overload from feeds will find a market. Bridges from the pull-based mechanism of <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom to push-based messaging services like <span class="caps">SMS</span>, Email, or IM will probably also do well. And of course, it would be smart for makers of web analytics software to also look at measuring conversions and clickthroughs from feed links.</p>


	<p><strong>Syndication Will Drive <span class="caps">REST </span>Web Services</strong> &#8211; One of the common complaints leveled against <a href="http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html">REST-based Web Services</a> is that the simple model of <a href="http://www.prescod.net/rest/encoding/">REST does not specify the <span class="caps">XML</span> representation for data</a> (unlike the case of <span class="caps">XML</span>-RPC and <span class="caps">SOAP</span>). This will never officially change, but I think it will become increasingly more common to see <span class="caps">REST </span>Web Services that return <span class="caps">RSS</span>-like data for searches. Indeed, throw in Amazon&#8217;s <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">OpenSearch extensions for <span class="caps">RSS</span></a> and you have support for presenting pagination within <span class="caps">RSS</span> documents. The practical upshot of this is that programmers can use the exact same code for <span class="caps">RSS</span>, Search Engine Plugins (<em>if any other engines besides A9.com support OpenSearch_</em>), and <span class="caps">REST</span>-based Web Services. More significantly, this makes <span class="caps">REST</span> more compelling to these programmers, since supporting <span class="caps">SOAP</span>&#8217;s data encoding would require supporting an additional data format for searches and more code to implement. Similarly, the arrival of the <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/12/07/catching-up-with-the-atom-publishing-protocol.html">Atom Publishing Protocol</a> will also bring awareness of <span class="caps">REST </span>Web Services to a wider market of people who will be using it without even knowing it.</p>


	<p><strong>Feed Extensions Will Get Wider Support</strong> &#8211; As <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom grows in its usage, it should be possible to find more aggregators and process that also support the more popular extensions to feeds (these are normally specified within the document in a separate namespace). I think a few extensions will become essential in the years ahead (and I don&#8217;t even know if they exist currently!): support for threading of <span class="caps">RSS</span> items (for feeds based on email lists); partial encryption of <span class="caps">RSS</span> documents to be decrypted in the reader (would allow banks to offer feeds for instance); geographic tagging for marking stories (see the breaking news/photos on a map). In any event, I think good aggregators will show in some fashion all tags embedded in the feed so that users could search or filter based upon them.</p>


	<p><strong>Syndication in the Enterprise</strong> &#8211; Finally, it is obvious that <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom will become more common within corporate intranets as well. And the <a href="/articles/2005/09/23/rss-comes-to-the-enterprise">credit for this belongs to Microsoft</a> of all companies. Mainly, by placing <span class="caps">RSS</span> within all aspects of Windows Vista, Microsoft will drag all sorts of big <span class="caps">IT </span>Departments into accepting <span class="caps">RSS</span> as a solution for messaging and event notification. This will in turn make them more likely to also accept other solutions based on syndication. In fact, I&#8217;m optimistic enough to think that <span class="caps">B2B </span>Syndication-based products will do better than <span class="caps">B2C </span>(remember that vexing 4% recognition rate from above; CTOs can mandate use in their companies). Smaller companies will be quick to embrace the immediacy of <span class="caps">RSS</span> and larger companies will also enjoy it for Windows Vista integration.</p>


	<p><strong>Atom vs. <span class="caps">RSS2</span>.0 Holy Wars Won&#8217;t Matter</strong> I know it vexes some readers of this posting that I&#8217;m using <span class="caps">RSS</span> sometimes as a shorthand phrase for <span class="caps">RSS2</span>.0 or Atom-based syndication. And I agree with them that Atom is technically superior while <span class="caps">RSS2</span>.0 has better market share. But my ultimate feeling is that the differences between the two for the consumer will be largely academic (like caring about whether your audio player is playing <span class="caps">MP3</span> or <span class="caps">AAC</span>), since any good aggregator or processor should just be able to handle both formats effortlessly.</p>


	<p>I will probably follow up on some of these points in more depth anon, but feel free to comment and quibble in the comments section below. I am no industry expert, but I do so like to make guesses about the business. And I&#8217;m curious what you think as well. Check in next year and we&#8217;ll how well they turned out.</p>
