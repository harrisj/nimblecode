<p>Like many technically oriented people, I have been following the recent upsurge of interest in exploring <em>Life Hacks</em> at places like <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a><a> (</a><a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/">wiki</a>), <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">Life Hacker</a>, or <a href="http://www.tradetricks.org/">Tricks of the Trade</a>. And, don't get me wrong, there are some cool tips in there on how to do things, but sometimes it's also easy to feel a bit overwhelmed at some of "Hypergeeky Hints From Heloise" tips given like</p>

<blockquote> Why not "fog proof" the mirror before the shower? Two drops of liquid hand soap (or shower gel) on a folded tissue, apply to the mirror in wide circular motions (if it is a big mirror, you can do just the center part, so you can see at least yourself) until it seems you've done nothing (all the soap disappears). The water vapor will not condensate over the soap unless you take a really long shower</blockquote>

<p>That is why part of me is rather amused to read <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/how_to/the_nonexpert_life_hacks_for_the_rest_of_us.php">Life Hacks for the Rest of Us</a>, a tongue-in-cheek selection of life hacks for people like me. Those who would like to do things better or more efficiently at times, but are often too busy, too lazy, or some combination of both to care. And who aren't above "faking it" sometimes either. Some highlights:</p>

<blockquote>If you claim to have read all the books on your shelves (but you really havenâ€™t), when somebody asks you what a certain (um, unread) book is about or what you thought of it, say â€œIâ€™ll let you find out for yourself,ï¿½? and pressure them to borrow it from you.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>Have a goal you keep telling everyone youâ€™re trying to attain but havenâ€™t yet found the energy or willpower to achieve? Write something that alludes to it (e.g., a plot timeline for your â€œnovelï¿½?) on a piece of paper and tape it to the wall. When your friends see it theyâ€™ll assume youâ€™re striving, which, as we just noted, is half your battle.</blockquote>

are just perfect. Go read the whole thing. While you're at it, also check out 43 Folders' good self parody for April Fools, <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/04/april_power_hac.html">April Power Hacks</a>.
