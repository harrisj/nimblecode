I've had a contentious relationship with Dave Winer.

I know he likes to ruffle feathers and make outrageous statements. I know he can veer between outright hostility and then overweening sensitivity. We have different opinions on many things, but generally I've shrugged it off; I actually am a media hacker with work to do. But recently, I lost my cool. Dave Winer has had a long-running hostility to Twitter's <a href="">Suggested User List</a> (SUL), because he feels it puts Twitter in the role of <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/12/whyItsTimeToBreakOutOfTwit.html">king-maker promoting certain accounts over others</a>. I personally feel it's Twitter's site and they can do what they want, and there makes some sense in them indicating some accounts for people to start with (as full disclosure: I should note that the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nytimes">@nytimes</a> account has been on the SUL off and on at various points). But then the argument veers through the looking glass.

Twitter created the SUL because they felt it would be good for new users to subscribe to a bunch of prominent accounts (eg, news sources, tech people, celebrities), although this admittedly makes accounts on the list prominent in themselves. But in Dave's evolving argument, Twitter instead is a sinister puppet-master that purposefully places tech bloggers and media companies on the list so they will be beholden to twitter and promote the company further. The argument goes like this:

<ol>
<li>Being on the SUL is worth an "obviously" tremendous value that has conveniently never been approximated (For a while, Dave and others quoted <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/12/how-much-is-a-suggested-slot-on-twitter-worth-jason-calacanis-offers-250000/">Jason Calacanis' $250K a month offer</a> to be on the list, but <a href="http://twitter.com/JasonCalacanis/status/1939303783">he has admitted that was a joke.</a>)</li>
<li>Twitter and recipients understand the value of being on the SUL and Twitter uses it to keep bloggers and media companies in line.</li>
<li>The value of this is so immense that it </li>
</ol>

Since being on the SUL is worth an immense (but never quantified) value, these companies in turn cannot help but be indebted to twitter. And so they are collectively guilty by association. He started by maligning TechCrunch and <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/04/12/doesMashableHaveCredibilit.html">Mashable</a>. Since then, twitter's dark web of corruption has apparently expanded even to the Gray Lady, and this skein of an argument reached its absurd apotheosis when Winer accused the New York Times of running <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/technology/personaltech/07basics.html?_r=1&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=twitter&amp;st=Search">a personal technology how-to about twitter clients</a> as a payback to Twitter:

<blockquote>BTW, I love the way the NY Times, a member of the S.U.L. ran a tutorial for Twitter newbies. A little quid pro quo?? Perhaps? &mdash; <a href="http://friendfeed.com/davew/e0f3f83c/btw-i-love-way-ny-times-member-of-u-l-ran-tutorial">Dave Winer</a></blockquote>

Because really, why else would the New York Times run a how-to on twitter in a personal technology column of all places unless commanded by the dark hand of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ev">Ev</a>?

 as his latest argument <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/05/29/isThereValueInBeingOnTheSu.html">latest argument</a> (since rewritten to remove the reference to the Times and me) was that the NYT was in thrall to Twitter. He continues this point in a comment:

<blockquote>The question is this -- when the NYT is put on the SUL have they received something of value? The only way they can accept it, imho, is if it has zero value. They write a lot of articles about Twitter. It would be like reviewing Ford cars, and then Ford giving them a fleet of cars. They can buy the cars from Ford and review them, nothing wrong with that. But they can't receive them for free. And they certainly can't receive them without telling people, when they read a car review, that they have a potential bias in
favor of one of the companies.

That's the issue. Not whether it has precedent or not -- of course it does.  There are dirty publications everywhere. At first it was understandable that there was some confusion, and Twitter didn't ask in advance if they wanted to be on the list. But this has been going on for a number of weeks now, so the excuse is wearing out. &mdash; <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/05/29/isThereValueInBeingOnTheSu.html#comment-10283126">Dave Winer</a></blockquote>

And that is the moment where I lost it. To provide some background, I had been asking <a href="http://friendfeed.com/davew/e60477ec/harrisj-i-ve-found-ways-to-measure-that-too-and">Dave Winer</a> what his calculation for the value of being on the SUL was, since it's the linchpin of his theory (now that the $250K one was out the window). In this post, instead of exploring the question, he decided to double down on his previous attacks. And so I commented the following (<em>Dave Winer refused to approve this comment and suggested I should run it on my own blog instead.</em>):

<blockquote>I would have to disagree with your application on this point. It's a rather simplistic value of conflict of interest that rests on two tenuous assumptions. 

The first is that the SUL has a tremendous value to companies like the NY Times (despite your assertion that it's self-evident, I have yet to see any real effort from you to define its value). So let's try. You suggest the companies linked on the SUL get large amounts of traffic that drives ad revenue. From my experience, clickthrough rates from twitter have been astonishingly low (you can look at the bit.ly stats on any nytimes feed). But let's look at the Onion, which has the advantage of being able to craft its own news rather than rely on reality. So, 800K+ followers. For a given link posted to twitter, ~8000 clickthroughs. Let's assume a $5 CPM ad rate to be generous (probably lower). Total worth of each tweet = $40. KA-CHING! For very large media companies, it's even worse. Much as I like twitter and the conversation on it, as a traffic driver it's extremely small, and I guess you would actually have to measure the worth of SUL-driven follower traffic in relative terms rather than absolute to be accurate (if I give $10 to someone who has $100, it's much more significant than to someone with $10 million). I welcome other ways of estimating the worth of being on the SUL, but right now it might as well be measured in magic beans (or joke pricing by Calacanis). I think you recognize that the value is small, which is why you think any value at all is suspect, but I think that's a reductive argument to, since it might as well be stated as "media companies should not be on the Internet at all, since any traffic from other sites (whether directly or by suggested user lists) has some value and any value is suspect." Which leads me to assumption two.

The second assumption is that the normal mechanisms that separate the newsroom from the business/marketing side of the operation somehow are not working here. Amazingly enough, the New York Times receives significant real cash transactions from companies every day. It's called advertising, and you've already written about the "Chinese wall" that separates the business/marketing operations of newspapers from the editorial production side. Do you find yourself doubting the neutrality of the Times when you see an Apple ad on the front page? What makes being on the Twitter suggested user list different? Especially since unlike an ad, it seems to have a very nebulous value.

Finally, I don't really see what excuse needs to be proffered and why we actually care whether twitter has the NYT on the SUL. It's their site and they can do what they want. RSS feed readers can put the Times as an initial feed. You can tweet our articles in your twitter stream. It would only be an excuse if there were a problem, and calling the New York Times a dirty publication (like you have smeared Mashable and others before) merely because Twitter thinks that some users might be interested in a feed of NY Times articles seems like a trial by innuendo.</blockquote>

As I stated before, this comment was blocked, so I have repeated it here verbatim to show my argument. I admit I was angry and in that way I may have reflected poorly on the Times, but I feel like if you're going to make one of the most serious charges in journalism (conflict of interest), it had better be on evidence a lot less flimsy than this.
