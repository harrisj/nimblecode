If you want an excellent lesson in how web specifications can knock into modern DHTML interface design, check out <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_web_accelerator_hey_not_so_fast_an_alert_for_web_app_designers.php">this post at Signal vs. Noise</a> on how the well-meaning goals of Google Web Accelerator have wreaked havoc on modern interactive web sites. Be sure to read the comments as well. I would post more commentary on this here, but I have already spent enough time following it up in the thread over there.
