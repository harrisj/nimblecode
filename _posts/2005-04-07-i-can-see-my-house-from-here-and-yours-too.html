<p>Second day blogging and I am already late to the party in talking about the changes Google has made to the Maps program by incorporating the satellite imagery from Keyhole. The result is very cool, not just because it's neat to see things from space, but because the map functionality is overlaid right onto the satellite data as well (as <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=6744e802-6a07-4507-b952-30cb40684928">John Park shows with his bike route</a>). What I like about this is what I also like about people using the maps with Flickr's annotation capabilities to present <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/memorymap">memory maps</a> or people doing "virtual tourism" of sorts to get a feel of geography from afar, in that there's a real sense of play and fun and hacking going on with Google Maps that I haven't seen with a web service for a while. I will talk more about this later, since I think it's the difference between a successful web service and a dud.</p>
