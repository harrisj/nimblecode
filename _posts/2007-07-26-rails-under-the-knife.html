<p>After months of rehearsing and revising, I finally gave the talk at <span class="caps">OSCON</span>. I think it could use another month of refinement, but people seemed to enjoy it, and I actually enjoyed giving it as well. If you were at the talk, thank you for coming and feel free to let me know if you have any feedback or questions.</p>


	<p>My talk was <strong>Rails Under the Knife</strong>, a look at the some of the internals of Rails to get a better idea of 3 powerful Ruby techniques:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Metaprogramming</li>
		<li>Reflection</li>
		<li>Blocks</li>
	</ul>


	<p>You can download the slides at</p>

	</ul>


	<p>This talk is aimed at an intermediate Rails programmer who knows the basics of Rails coding (I have another similar talk for beginners called Rubyisms in Rails), but still is a bit unsure about the power trio of serious Rails hackery. Hopefully, this will help to provide some inspiration for you to delve into the Rails code on your own. Enjoy.</p>
