<p>This year, as an experiment I started living in public. By this, I don&#8217;t mean I jumped into the <a href="http://www.furiousseasons.com/archives/2006/12/love_american_style_web_20_and_narcissism_1.html">online exhibitionist extreme</a> that seems to be required for MySpace users, but I have started tracking my media consumption of books/movies/music online. So, as a short post to tide everyone over until I gird myself to continue the <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/11/29/all-the-news-thats-fit-to-serve">never-ending newspapers series</a>, here&#8217;s a review of my year in media.</p>


	<p>In the last year, I read <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/person/harrisj/consumed/book">approximately 63 books</a>, of which the most notable were:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>The Ghost Map, by Steven Johnson</li>
		<li>The Echo Maker, by Richard Powers</li>
		<li>La Perdida, by Jessica Abel</li>
		<li>Maps of the Imagination, by Peter Turchi</li>
		<li>Rip It Up And Start Again, by Simon Reynolds</li>
	</ul>


	<p>This last year I also saw approximately <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/person/harrisj/consumed/movie">67 movies and TV shows</a> (new and rentals), of which the following 5 were the best, in no ranked order:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>The New World</li>
		<li>Little Miss Sunshine</li>
		<li>Aguirre, The Wrath of God</li>
		<li>Grizzly Man</li>
		<li>Veronica Mars, seasons 1&#38;2</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Finally, here were the top 10 bands I listened to last year, courtesy of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/harrisj/">last.fm</a></p>


	<ul>
	<li>Boards of Canada</li>
		<li>Xela</li>
		<li>Sigur RÃ³s</li>
		<li>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</li>
		<li>Ms. John Soda</li>
		<li>Thom Yorke</li>
		<li>The American Analog Set</li>
		<li>Ulrich Schnauss</li>
		<li>Aphex Twin</li>
		<li>Ladytron</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Anyhow, there you have it; my life as a consumer for one year (but am I going to go see movies this weekend? Yes!) Anyhow, happy new year and see you all next year! If you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ve got some more books to read.</p>
