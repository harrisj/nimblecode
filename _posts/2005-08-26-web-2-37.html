<p>Mark my words, <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/hoodwinkDDayThreeClearnessOfVision.html">Hoodwink.d</a> is one of the silliest and yet coolest new things to hit the web in a while. I won&#8217;t tell you more, but I hope to see you there soon.</p>


	<p><strong>Update</strong>: I stand corrected. Hoodwink.d is really a vile plot to destroy the Internet as we know it and rob us of all we love and hold dear. The resulting collapse of faith in our electronic friends will of course trigger despair, disillusionment, doubt, and more consumption of rich chocolately ice cream (it&#8217;s not all dystopic). It&#8217;s dire, but not inevitable. This can be averted now before it&#8217;s too late. Do your part. Keep using Internet Explorer. Try not to tinker. And definitely steer clear of a man called Json Parser. Thank you.</p>
