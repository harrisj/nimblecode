<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to just come out and say it, so here we go: I suck at blogging these days. This is not me beating myself &#8211; I don&#8217;t feel bad in the slightest &#8211; I just am acknowledging the truth of the matter. Sorry for any of my readers who haven&#8217;t consigned me to the dustbins of their feed readers yet, but it&#8217;s unlikely I will be producing any riveting content anytime in the near future. I have a lot of changes in my life coming up &#8211; new coop! baby! projects here at the Times! &#8211; that I&#8217;m spent when I get home to blog (of course, thanks to Time-Warner Cable I haven&#8217;t had Internet at home anyway) and don&#8217;t produce any writing that meets my high standards for <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/02/16/original-blogging-content">Original Blogging Content</a> (TM).</p>


	<p>However, I do still have time to feed content into a few other places, for those that need to get their Jake fix. For starters, you can follow the minutiae of my random thoughts (all less then 140 characters) at <a href="http://twitter.com/harrisj">Twitter</a>. In addition, I have started what&#8217;s known as a tumbleblog over on <a href="http://harrisj.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, which is where I will post content that&#8217;s the opposite of Nimble Code: pithy, snarky, non-technical, and varied. Feel free to check both out and one day I will get back to writing here as well.</p>


	<p>Finally, if you were interested in some of the topics from my <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/11/29/all-the-news-thats-fit-to-serve">Future of Newspapers</a> posts but want to see a professional journalist&#8217;s perspective, I strongly suggest Frontline&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar/">News War</a> series, being broadcast now on <span class="caps">PBS</span> and also viewable on the Web.</p>
