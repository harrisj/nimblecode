<p>I&#8217;m not much of a blogger these days. Between my <a href="http://nytimes.com/">day job</a> and some of its <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/">high-priority projects</a> and my spare time at home with my family, including one rambunctious toddler, lengthy self-reflection is not often in the cards, especially since I <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/">blog there too!</a></p>


	<p>But I do <a href="http://www.twitter.com/harrisj">twitter</a>. <a href="http://twitter.grader.com/harrisj">A lot</a>. Which makes sense, because twitter offers me a sweet combination of low demands (<em>even I can do 140 characters of text regularly</em>), convenient access (<em>via all sorts of third-party tools</em>), and the superficial-yet-addictive connectedness of <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/ambient-intimacy/">ambient intimacy</a>. Recently, I was asked to deliver a few introductory talks about twitter at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>&#8212;where I work and where I created the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nytimes">nytimes twitter feeds</a> for my own benefit back in March 2007. I had done this before, but I lost those slides in a laptop malfunction, and I figured it would be fun to start fresh and experiment with a scrolling transition to suggest the fluid nature of twitter timelines. This is hard to see in a <span class="caps">PDF</span>, so I&#8217;m sharing them here in two formats.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://harrisj-share.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter.pdf">PDF</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://harrisj-share.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter.mov">Quicktime</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>Note that this is not the complete presentation. Although none of the information in here is confidential, I&#8217;ve been asked to remove a few slides near the end where I suggest some future directions for twitter usage at the New York Times. I have personally been thinking about twitter and the news a lot recently (more blog posts on that later) and thought it would be cool to suggest some ideas and examples. But I don&#8217;t want anyone to assume I am the Official Strategist for Twitter at the Times and any of my personal musings are corporate or editorial strategy. So, those slides had to go.</p>


	<p>Enjoy.</p>
