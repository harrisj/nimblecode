<p>Not really, but that certainly seems to be the attitude of the first poster in the Signal Vs. Noise post <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/2005/04/ajax_taking_off.php">Ajax Takes Off</a></p>

<blockquote>Great, so someone coins a new phrase in a shitty effort to attach themselves to a concept thatâ€™s been used for several years. What about the developers that found this solution? Do you see them hitting dozens of blogs shamelessly promoting themselves? No, theyâ€™re working on the next cool idea that inevitably some loser will try to stamp there name.</blockquote>

<p>This is where quite frankly most developers annoy me. There is a large fraction of the population that are averse to any hype or popularity or style by nature. And so, it leads to this insane posturing about street cred when others stumble across their favorite technology. And so they attack the polish, they smear the evangelists, and they even will destroy their favorite technology in order to save it.</p>

<p>Dude, <em>whatever</em>. Personally, I am quite glad to the coining of the term AJAX for the nimble bag of technologies that is XML, XHTML, Javascript, XmlHttpRequest, quick server-side components, etc. <a href="http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000680033817/">Nobody likes to pronounce XmlHttpRequest</a>. Having a nice-punchy-if-somewhat-reductive term is useful, especially when pitching your website improvements to those in management who ultimately decide your projects. Yes, Ajax is <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/03/ajax_promise_or.html">a bit of hype</a>, but it's <em>useful</em> hype. Embrace it.</p>

<p>Besides, any thing that can be a reference to Greek Mythology, a cleansing product, or a soccer team can't be that bad.</p>
