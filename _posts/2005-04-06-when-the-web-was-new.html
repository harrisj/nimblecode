<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/04/wo/wo_040405web.asp">flash from the past</a>, courtesy of <cite>Technology Review</cite>. It's a reprinting of an article about the growing pains of the Web back in 1995. And what's especially funny to me is the screenshot of <a href="http://web.mit.edu">Mit's Homepage</a> back in 1995. If you squint really closely, you can see the address of MIT's official server back then was <code>web.mit.edu</code>, because the domain <code>www.mit.edu</code> was actually the location of an earlier server set up by the esteemed <a href="http://www.mit.edu/sipb/sipb.html">Student Information Processing Board (SIPB)</a>. Originally running on Plexus, a PERL web server implementation, it was one of the first 100 web servers in the world.</p>

<p>Why do I mention this history? Well, back then I was a student at MIT and a prospective member of SIPB, and someone suggested I might want to get involved in <a href="http://stuff.mit.edu/webmasters.html">being a webmaster</a>. And so this has brought on a bit of a wave of nostalgia for those heady really early days when HTML tags were strictly semantic, a URL on a billboard seemed an insane novelty, and we edited pages on the server by hand <em>in ed</em>. Good times.</p>
