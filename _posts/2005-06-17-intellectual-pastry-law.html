Intellectual Property Law is not really an area I'm expecting to write about often in this blog. Besides the fact that other people do it much better than me (see <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a> or <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/">Declan McCullough's Politech</a> for instance), and I must admit that I hew largely to the standard technocratic view on copyright, mainly that I am not opposed to it in principle (I'm happy to buy my music and movies), but I also think the current extensions to the duration of copyright is insane and too much power is being given to large corporations at the expense of future creativity and fair use. Nothing you won't find elsewhere, so I don't think this is an area I need to add my scintillating insight to that often.

That said, I do find this story (and attached discussion) at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a> titled <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/06/16/copyright_cops_crack.html">"Copyright cops crack down on cooks over cakes"</a> fascinating because it shows just how strange copyright has become and it's quite local to me too. The College Bakery is a nice little place in my neighborhood of Carroll Gardens where you can get lots of nice old-fashioned and wholesome pastry, cakes, pies, etc. To cut a long story short, <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a> noticed the last time he was in there that they had posted the sign above. As he puts it:
<blockquote>Now the decor and ambience of College Bakery are echt Old Brooklyn, so it's an unlikely front in the copyfight, but the staff said they had to bust out the magic markers because they'd been roped in as the front line of defense against non-licit images of Dora the ExplorerÂ® and Thomas the Tank EngineÂ®. </blockquote>
Yes, it's come to this. The large fortunes of Nickelodeon or other copyright holders are so threatened by the few custom cakes that the College Bakery makes a week that they had to take action. And certainly, I suppose there are other large bakeries that have paid licensing fees that are nominally harmed by the "infringing activity" here. But, honestly who cares? Are the property rights of copyright so paramount and absolute that it's worth denying some six year old who loves Dora (and probably has bought a fair share of Dora merchandise) one lousy cake? Do the copyright holders need to defend everything with an iron fist? More importantly, are we ceding ownership of our culture and our creativity to large corporations?
