<p>It seems like only yesterday I was mocking the <a href="/blog/?p=11">SNIF technology for tracking dog social networks</a> (ie, for selling a new expensive electronic device to dog owners with too much disposable income). But reading that, you might've been thinking, <em>what if I own a chicken as a pet? What device can help me?</em> Well, fret no more, because the Mixed Reality lab in Singapore has a solution for you (I hope this is a hoax, but it seems not): <a href="http://mixedreality.nus.edu.sg/research/PI/PI_webpage/research-PI-infor.htm">Poultry Internet</a>! This system consists of a remote monitoring device with tactile sensors that allows the user to track a chicken's movements at home from the office and <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">freak out remotely</span> pet the chicken by petting the robot proxy. Be sure also to check out the <a href="http://mixedreality.nus.edu.sg/MEDIA/all%20videos/PI/PI(web).mov">video</a> to see the system in action, hear the cool background music, and come away inspired by the mission statement:



<blockquote>Poultry Internet provides a new cybernetic direction and experience for both we humans and our poultry friends.</blockquote>



It's a beautiful world.</p>
