Because the world doesn't have enough blog analysis on this topic already, I figure I'll wade into the fray with a few points I haven't noticed elsewhere yet (in pithy bullet form!). <strong>Update:</strong> I've decided to add some links to the best analysis I've seen so far.

<ul>
<li>Like most mac-heads, I must admit I feel a bit dismayed at Steve Jobs having a love fest with Intel. At the very least, I was hoping for AMD or someone else instead, but Intel? Ah well, I guess we'll get used to it.</li>
<li>Don't panic yet though. Although there will be an x86 inside, Apple is not abandoning making Macs. I imagine you won't be able to install OS X on any PC. Apple is still a hardware company and still wants to control every aspect of the machine. It will still have a Mac ROM, still boot with OpenFirmware and still have a paltry choice of video cards. It's limited I know, but I think the control that Apple has over the underlying hardware really helps to make OS X a better experience.</li>
<li>Processing power matters. Apple has managed to do more with less by doing things gracefully, but that only goes so far. To really get into the media center business, particularly the HDTV home consumer market, the Mini needs more horsepower. Heat dissipation is going to be a challenge though.</li>
<li>Some have said the crucial point behind the switch is the Pentium D's Digital Rights Management capabilities. Leander Kahney thinks this will be key for Apple wooing Hollywood studios for digital movie content, but I must lament that it will someday be impossible to find hardware without DRM built in.</li>
<li>I guess Windows emulation will be a whole lot faster now.</li>
<li>Although Apple has gained an advantage in processing power, I feel they've lost a fair amount of clout in controlling some aspects of computer design. A lot of work went into the holistic design of the G5 Powermacs, but I somehow wonder if Intel would want to do the same for Apple (holistic design isn't really part of the PC market's style). Apple is no longer a big fish in a small pond (like it was with the PowerPC), but is instead a smaller fish in a big pond. If Intel ever has to choose between making Apple happy or Dell happy, I think the lovefest will be over.</li>
<li>Intel has had a terrible track record in delivering 64-bit chips (unlike competitor AMD). I wonder how this move is going to affect people who needed the 64-bit capabilities of the G5.</li>
<li>This move also marks the continuing ascendency of the appliance part of Apple over the computer business. I think Steve Jobs is just tired of the chip design part of the business and would rather farm that aspect off to someone else (even though it means some loss of control). More importantly, unlike IBM, Intel makes more than one class of chip and I imagine the real ramifications of this move will not be high-end Pentiums in computers but lower end chips in tablets, cheaper Macs and a proliferation of appliances.</li>
<li>So, how exactly are they planning to sell any computers in the next year? Better hope iPod sales stay strong.</li>
<li>I hope I never have to see one of those Intel Inside stickers on my Mac. Those things are ugly.</li>
</ul>

Well, these certainly are interesting times. For further reading on the subject and speculation, I recommend one of the following links:

<li>O'Reilly interviewed <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7201">some big Mac developers on the switch.</a> Overall views are actually positive.</li>

<li><a href="http://arstechnica.com/columns/mac/mac-20050607.ars">Ars Technica mourns the PowerPC</a>. I agree that the PowerPC was an elegant chip, and it's a shame to see the best hope for RISC bowled over by the ugly might of the x86 architecture.</li>
