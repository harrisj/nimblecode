For an amusing joke (if you're a web geek that is), look at the announcement for
<a href="http://upcoming.org/event/20836/">Web 1.0 at House of Shields (Wednesday, October 5, 2005)</a> in San Francisco. From the agenda:
<blockquote>We will meet to discuss line breaks, spacer gifs, and the ability to launch links in a new browser window.</blockquote>
Cutting edge stuff. Although I am surprised there is no seminar like "The &lt;blink&gt; tag: how much is too much?"
