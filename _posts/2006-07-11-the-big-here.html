<p>Okay, this is another filler article. I&#8217;ve got a lot of big things I&#8217;m working on I can&#8217;t quite post about yet. But I feel like I have to at least try to post more than once every two weeks. Anyway,</p>


	<p>I got an surprising 25/30 (and 2 of the bonus questions).</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/07/the-big-here">Jason Kottke gave it a shot</a></p>


	<p><strong>Questions I Got Right</strong></p>


	<p><em>1) Point north.</em> A little bit harder when you work downtown below the grid plan, but as Kottke also observed the street grid of Manhattan is a useful guide, albeit one pointing about 30 degrees east of North (otherwise, <a href="http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/cityofstars.html">Manhattanhenge</a> would happen on the equinox)</p>


	<p><em>2) What time is sunset today?</em> Owning a dog leaves me with a good approximate idea of the sunset each day, although I can not tell you it exactly. But I&#8217;m giving me this one anyway.</p>


	<p><em>3) Trace the water you drink from rainfall to your tap.</em> There are several reservoirs in Westchester and Rockland county that bring water into Manhattan by way of the Croton Reservoir. Currently, New York has 2 water tunnels serving it, but neither can be taken offline for repairs. Water Tunnel #3 is <a href="http://www.ita-aites.org/cms/319.html">still under construction</a> (started in 1970, but not expected to be completed until 2020).</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re a big fan of infrastructure and urban exploration, Jessica Solis&#8217; &#8220;New York Underground&#8221; is an rollicking collection of stories and photographs from various unauthorized excursions around the city. The book starts off with a look at the water structure including a stretch of rafting down Tunnel #1 from Croton to Harlem.</p>


	<p><em>4) When you flush, where do the solids go? What happens to the waste water?</em> This is not a topic for the squeamish, but I know it anyway. Thanks to the excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316738263">Garbageland: On The Secret Trail of Trash</a> by Elizabeth Royte, I know my solids and waste water go to a treatment plant at Owl Point north of Bay Ridge in Brooklyn. There they are treated and the cleaned water is eventually released into the bay. Meanwhile, the city is trying to find a good market for fertilizer created from the solid waste (it&#8217;s excellent for mushrooms apparently), but the human origins of it make it a hard sell. Aren&#8217;t you glad you know that now?</p>


	<p><em>5) How many feet above sea level are you?</em> My home is about 14 meters above sea level. Thank you Internet for the <a href="http://flood.firetree.net/">flood map</a>!</p>


	<p><em>7) How far do you have to travel before you reach a different watershed? Can you draw the boundaries of yours?</em> I could travel down to the Delaware river or into Connecticut to find the next one.</p>


	<p><em>8) Is the soil under your feet, more clay, sand, rock or silt?</em> It varies. In Manhattan a lot of the soil is rock, specifically schist (a fun word to say), which is why we have skyscrapers (except where the bedrock level dips under Greenwich Village). However, a large part of Brooklyn and Manhattan&#8217;s waterfront is actually landfill, which I guess would count as a mix of clay, rock, and silt.</p>


	<p><em>9) Before your tribe lived here, what did the previous inhabitants eat and how did they sustain themselves?</em> There have been a lot of tribes through Manhattan in some sense. Not counting <a href="http://www.ellisisland.org/default.asp">the waves of migration</a> and <a href="http://www.tenement.org/">gentrification before mine</a>, the island even changed nations. Before the British took over, New York was New Amsterdam, and Russell Shorto&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385503490/104-7362462-8543137?n=283155">The Island at the Center of the World</a> is a nice book to read if you&#8217;re fascinated. Of course though, the original inhabitants were not the Dutch, but the Native Americans, and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140004006X/">1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus</a>  is an excellent summary of new research about America before the Europeans.</p>

	<p>So what tribe was here when the Dutch arrived? Various tribes of the <a href="http://www.delawaretribeofindians.nsn.us/">Lenape</a> were here and greeted English, Dutch, and Swedish explorers when they sailed up the coast. From accounts of people like Henry Hudson (who visited in 1609; New Yorkers, get ready for the massive 400th anniversary events), we know they farmed corn and beans, ate wild game, and especially enjoyed the rich food selections from the fertile New York Estuary.</p>

	<p>Specifically, they consumed a lot of oysters, as Mark Kurlansky&#8217;s latest book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345476387">The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell</a> charmingly relates. It may seem a bit hard to discern today amidst the concrete and the skyscrapers and the chemical plants of New Jersey, but New York city has an amazing natural harbor, with three rivers and the sea forming a rich estuary for marshlands. This was excellent for shipping, and New York today is as direct result of its early maritime advantages. But it was really excellent for oysters.</p>
