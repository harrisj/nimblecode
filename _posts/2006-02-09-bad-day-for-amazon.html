<p>It seems like it was only yesterday that I was loudly praising <a href="/articles/2005/12/14/amazon-shakes-things-up">the bold moves Amazon was making in search</a>, but now that is probably going to end. The head of Amazon&#8217;s A9 search service Udi Manber has <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002325.php">jumped ship to Google</a>. Bummer for Amazon. I guess Google is becoming the Microsoft of search, scooping up everybody eventually.</p>
