For those of you who might be interested, I wrote a post for the <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/">NY Times Open blog</a> on the <a href="http://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish web cache</a> titled <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/using-varnish-so-news-doesnt-break-your-server/">Using Varnish So News Doesn't Break Your Server.</a> For those of you, who prefer watching video, I also <a href="http://webpulp.tv/post/1049061452/new-york-times-jacob-harris">talked to Webpulp.tv about Varnish</a>. That is all.
