	<p>It&#8217;s that time of the year again, when the air gets a certain crispness, snatches of holiday song fill the air, and everybody communes with their friends and family, joined in warmth by their shared commitment to one thing: figuring out their <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2005/12/19/calculate-your-nytyiih-score">New York Times Year In Ideas Hipness score</a>. For those of you who missed this last year, I&#8217;ve started the personal tradition of reading through the New York Times Magazine&#8217;s annual <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2006/12/10/magazine/index.html">Year In Ideas</a> issue and tabulating how many of the collected phenomena I had known about beforehand. This is no mere game; a sufficiently high score is the only thing that allows me to still bask in the comfort of being &#8220;with it&#8221;, so please appreciate the seriousness of this moment.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been a bit late coming to the game this year (it&#8217;s been a really busy December), but now is the moment of truth and a big game day question: Now that I actually work at the <em>Times</em>, how will that affect my score? On the one hand, I am that much closer to the elitist, liberal, intellectual mindset the <em>Times</em> is so renowned for, so that should conceivably help my score. But &#8211; and I am painfully aware of the irony here &#8211; I find myself with so much less time to read the news these days now that I&#8217;m actually working for it, which might detract from my score.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;ve never read the Year in Ideas issue, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2006/12/10/magazine/index.html">give it a gander</a> and see how much you recognize. I&#8217;m sure there will be some things you recognize a little, some you&#8217;ve known for years (as the picture shows, I&#8217;m very aware that shipping containers explain everything), and some things that will completely surprise you. And if you&#8217;re feeling competitive, tally up your score and see how intellectually hip you are. My results follow:</p>

	<p>There you have it. A total score of 46 out of 74, for a <span class="caps">NYTYIIH</span> score of <strong>55.4%</strong>! Given the wide-ranging scope of ideas, this might seem decent enough, except <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2005/12/19/calculate-your-nytyiih-score">last year I scored an impressive 65.38%</a>. Oh the humanity! I guess I&#8217;m now longer the idea hipster/coolhunter I thought I was. But can you do better?</p>
