<p><em>In which the author continues to use a title formulation&#8212;one that seems right out of the 19th century, but these days denotes a certain overweening preciousness well suited to be published by <a href="http://store.mcsweeneys.net/">McSweeney&#8217;s</a>&#8212;to explain his long absence from-,</em></p>


	<p>Ah, screw it. The question on the minds of my remaining readers (all 10 of you) might be where the heck have I been (<em>sorry for the sad invective, but I&#8217;ve been trying to cut down on my cursing for reasons that should soon be clear</em>) and why am I blogging again now? 250-some days is a long day to be quiet, and it&#8217;s not like the blog was that awesome before it went on hiatus. What happened?</p>


	<p>Good question. To be honest, the main reason is I&#8217;ve been rather busy. For starters, I have still been blogging all  this while, but for the New York Times&#8217; open source initiatives at our blog <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/author/harrisj/">Open</a>.  The main reason though is that I am <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harrisj/tags/alex/">a proud father</a>  of the most amazing kid in thr world. It&#8217;s not that the baby keeps me from blogging, rather it&#8217;s just that blogging doesn&#8217;t really compare at all to spending time with him (<em>my personal coding productivity has similarly been very low</em>). Especially since, to be bluntly honest, the writing on this blog had become as boring as listening to a Garrison Keillor marathon. Better not to do it.</p>


	<p>So, why restart now? Because it just feels fun again. And because I actually feel like it might also be <strong>interesting</strong> as well to continue my musings on the future of newspapers (<em>and my experiences and experiments along those lines</em>) in a forum that is not as official and fraught with consequences for misplayed snark like the official New York Times blog would be.</p>


	<p>This is not to say I will be dishing dirt and spilling secrets. I like my job  enough to not want to lose it, and that&#8217;s not really my style. But I think it would be fun (<em>at least to me</em>) to post my occasional rants with perspective from inside the New York Times, and perhaps, if I&#8217;m lucky, fun for some random people on the Interwebs to read it. Sound like a plan?</p>


	<p>If worse comes to worse, I&#8217;ll just stop again. It wouldn&#8217;t be the first time&#8230;</p>
