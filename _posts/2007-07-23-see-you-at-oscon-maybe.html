<p>I know I haven&#8217;t been posting to this blog much lately (see <a href="http://open.nytimes.com/">this link</a> for one reason why). But I just wanted to note that I will be giving a talk at <span class="caps">OSCON 2007</span> in Portland this week, and I would love to talk to you if you are there.</p>

</ul>

	<p>In addition, my coworker will be giving a talk on the DBSlayer (one of the projects we&#8217;re open sourcing) that should be fun to see.</p>

</ul>

	<p>Finally, be sure to come to one of our Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions:</p>

	<p>Now I just have to make it there, which is the subject of another angry post about disconnecting effects of technology, or how United Airlines can oversell flights and then randomly bump  a father and mother with 2-month old infant leaving them to scramble for a flight next day. To be followed by 45 minutes waiting in a customer service line only to be told I&#8217;m supposed to go to a customer service station in the next terminal. Joy!</p>


	<p>The shorter version of this story: United Airlines is a miserable and indecent excuse for a business and when they go bankrupt again, I shan&#8217;t shed a tear&#8230;</p>
