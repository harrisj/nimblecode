<div style="float:left;padding-right:.5em;" class="flickrplugin"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36521959321@N01/44349798"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/28/44349798_0e487287bc_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Web2MemeMap"></a></div> Courtesy of Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/foocamp05/index.cgi">Foo Camp</a> (which I am definitely not cool enough to be invited to), there is now a picture to match the exciting flow of ideas and themes coalescing into <strong>Web 2.0</strong>. I think this assemblage of bubbles and trends is a great thing to see, especially since it serves as a better executive summary of high-level ideas than gleaning bits and pieces of the big picture from blogs and demo sites across the web.

	<p>That said, I think one thing is missing from the picture they provide. Maybe I am a bit <a href="/articles/tag/rss">preoccupied</a> with the subject, but I think <span class="caps">RSS </span>(<em>or Atom here, I&#8217;m just using <span class="caps">RSS</span> as shorthand for syndication</em>) is really one of the biggest things driving Web2.0 services and adoption these days, but it hasn&#8217;t even gotten a mention in the top as an influencing technology (unlike blogs or Gmail). I think blogs were great at establishing <span class="caps">RSS</span> as a way of keeping track of changes, but the really influential aspect of Del.icio.us and Flickr is not just tagging, but establishing <span class="caps">RSS</span> as a <a href="/articles/2005/09/23/rss-comes-to-the-enterprise">mechanism for tracking any possible view of the system you might want</a> in as light-weight and user-friendly mechanism as possible (as opposed to the awkwardness of <span class="caps">SOAP</span> or even <span class="caps">REST</span> to the end user).</p>


	<p>I think the source of my unease here is that I&#8217;m mostly a backend guy. A lot of my work at Alacra has been making sure that all sorts of information flows agilely between processes and servers. Backend stuff. It makes it happen, but if it&#8217;s working, you never notice how critical it is to success. Similarly, <span class="caps">AJAX</span> and other front-end browser mechanisms are very nice in my mind. But the biggest joys and successes of Web2.0 are all driven by the fluidity and ease of <span class="caps">RSS</span> and <span class="caps">REST</span>. &#8220;Hackability&#8221;, &#8220;Data as Intel Inside&#8221;, &#8220;Right to Remix&#8221; ... <span class="caps">RSS</span> made this a possibility and these are what drives me to take Web2.0 seriously and not just as another wave of web hype. All I&#8217;m asking for is a little recognition. Thanks.</p>


	<p><strong>Update:</strong> The good news is that it seems like I&#8217;m not alone in this view. The bad news is my company is <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/27#web20IsReallySimple">Dave Winer</a>.</p>
