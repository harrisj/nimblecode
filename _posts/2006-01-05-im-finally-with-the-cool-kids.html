<p>It&#8217;s been an excellent week for my geeky self-esteem, with beta invitations to both <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/">Ma.gnolia</a> (a new bookmarking site) and <a href="http://www.measuremap.com/">Measuremap</a> (a blog statistics tracking program). Both are written in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> and both look pretty awesome. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say (not sure how much I can legally say yet), but I will close with the observation that there&#8217;s an energy for new projects on the web I haven&#8217;t seen in years and that the <a href="http://caboo.se/">Ruby on Rails community</a> is one of the nicest and most open I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>


	<p>Ah well, two down, <a href="http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/">approximately 100 to go.</a></p>
