<p>I am aware there is something so deeply ironic about this, but I wanted to share a great link about the practice of blogging titled <a href="http://blogs.earthlink.net/2006/02/a_great_cd_is_not_a_failed_rad.php">A Great <span class="caps">CD </span>Is Not A Failed Radio Station</a>.
If you&#8217;re a blogger, you should read it. You can go there now, I&#8217;ll wait.</p>


	<p>Most blogs suck. They don&#8217;t really say anything new. This is largely because search engines, aggregators, and advertising models all encourage quantity over quality &#8211; many short and quick observations over long analysis. Search engines love <em>freshness</em> in content, and fresh posts mean more clicks means more advertising revenue. And so, many people labor strenuously to post <strong>daily</strong> to their blogs, even if this <a href="http://contentious.com/archives/2005/06/13/more-on-why-daily-blogging-really-is-usually-a-bad-idea">makes their writing suffer.</a></p>


	<p>The problem is that like any writing, blogging takes time and mental energy, and if you find yourself having to write daily or more, your blog postings will usually become little more than &#8220;me too&#8221; or &#8220;check this out&#8221; declarations &#8211; filler content with no real additional thought or analysis. This reductive trend is accelerated by the desire to want to be the <em>first post</em> to comment or link to something new on the web. This leads to initial kneejerk appraisals on big stories instead of more thoughtful analysis days later when the story is &#8220;old.&#8221; And so, the reckless pursuit of <em>freshness</em> in blog content only encourages <em>staleness</em> in the ideas on those pages. And the Internet begins to resemble Sunday political talk shows with their empty talking-points and flip-reactions.</p>


	<p>As you can see from my posting schedule, I&#8217;m hardly a victim of this syndrome (I&#8217;ll call it Premature Blogification). But if you find yourself on a never-ending race to keep up posting to your blog, maybe you should try a change. Get the Blogging Monkey off your back and embrace quality and sanity again. Your readers will love it. And so will you.</p>
