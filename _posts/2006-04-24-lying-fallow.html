<p>I&#8217;d like to apologize for the silence on this blog. Way back in the days before <a href="http://www.measuremap.com/">MeasureMap</a> I used to feel like I had to keep writing for my many regular readers (all 12 of you as I now know), but the inspiration has just not been there recently. It hasn&#8217;t helped that I have been out of town on 2 separate occasions and with enough work to keep me busy and focused. But I also have been purposefully staying away from my blog. It&#8217;s not that I can&#8217;t find things to post about, it&#8217;s just that I haven&#8217;t felt they&#8217;re really interesting enough to say (I like to do more than belabor the obvious).</p>


	<p>I hope to return with more content in the future, but this period of lying fallow has been immensely inspirational and productive in so many other ways; in short, it might be a while. Thanks again for your continued patronage.</p>
