Still busy, but there is a great article at O'Reilly Radar on how great frameworks are sometimes extracted wholesale from successful applications rather than built from scratch up. That is, it's <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/04/designing_from.html">often better to extract the framework from the application</a>, rather than build the application on top of a framework:

<blockquote>That is, at 37signals, they try to design the usability and function of the application first, and that drives the implementation. And if they can then extract a re-usable framework, all the better. For example, basecamp wasn't built on top of Ruby on Rails. Rather, Ruby on Rails was extracted from basecamp.</blockquote>

This echoes some of the complaints I was making earlier about the <a href="/blog/?p=22">unwieldiness of SOAP</a> for web standards. And it fits in with the philosophy of nimble technologies perfectly. Create a product, solve a need, and make it work great and the frameworks will follow, but complicated frameworks in themselves solve nothing.
