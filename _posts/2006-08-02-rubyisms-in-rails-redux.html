	<p>I am pleased to announce that the <a href="http://www.informit.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0321474074&#38;rl=1">digital shortcut <span class="caps">PDF</span> version</a> (to purchase, you have to go to the <a href="http://www.informit.com/shortcuts">Digital Shortcuts page</a> or you can buy it from <a href="http://safari.awprofessional.com/0321474074">Safari</a> Sorry!) of my <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/04/25/rubyisms-in-rails">Rubyisms in Rails</a> presentation is finally available for purchase. At 54 pages in length for the low price of $9.99, I guarantee you&#8217;ll glean at least 18.5 cents of insight from each page (disclaimer: that&#8217;s a mean instructional value; although gorgeous, the title page is not particularly educational in itself).</p>


	<p>In addition, the book is also now available in <a href="http://safari.awprofessional.com/">Safari Books Online</a>, and possibly Amazon or other retailers as well. Also, be sure to check out the list of <a href="http://www.informit.com/shortcuts">other upcoming Ruby titles</a>.</p>


	<p>So, what&#8217;s in it? If you&#8217;ve read the original presentation, you already have a sense of the scope of material I am covering here, but the shortcut allows me to focus on the material in greater depth. The result is a richer and more thorough examination of the examples presented in the original slides. If you are an intermediate to advanced Rails hacker, you probably know all this stuff already. But if you are a newcomer to Ruby through Rails, or you still find yourself still stuck coding <span class="caps">PHP</span> or Java-like Ruby, this ebook might help to align your thinking to the Ruby way.</p>


	<p>Will I write another ebook? I&#8217;d say yes, but I&#8217;ll have to think up another interesting topic. But if you are ever thinking of creating a technical book, I&#8217;d recommend starting in a smaller dose like this first. As I discovered, even 54 pages can be a lot of work, and it&#8217;s better to test out your time commitments and abilities with something small before you start pitching large references. But that&#8217;s a topic for another blog posting. Make me happy: <a href="http://www.informit.com/shortcuts">Buy the ebook</a> or <a href="http://safari.awprofessional.com/0321474074">read it on Safari</a> and give me your feedback. Thanks!</p>
