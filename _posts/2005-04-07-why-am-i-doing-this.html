<p>Okay, blogging has been around for a while to be sure. During all these years, I have been steadfast in my disdain and apathy towards blogging, deeming it little more than a way for overly extroverted people to drone on about their lives to what they imagine is a vast and enthralled audience. Which is probably still true, but why am I blogging? </p>

<p>Good question. In my haste to sneer at the writing crowd, I forgot that the appeal of blogging is that it is a simple and democratic communication mechanism, and this is the kicker: <em>communication is both essential for any career and it is often the one thing most holding back software developers like myself from succeeding.</em> Tim Bray of course says it better than me in his post <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/08/BloggingIsGood">Blogging Is Good</a> (a response to the many Blogging Will Get You Fired stories recently).

Most relevant in his top 10 list to me are
<blockquote>No matter how great you are, your career depends on communicating. The way to get better at anything, including communication, is by practicing. Blogging is good practice.</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>Networking is good for your career. Blogging is a good way to meet people.</blockquote>

Well put. Having recently understood the importance of networking and communication for career success (as important if not more so than technical skill), I feel it is time for me to recant my ways and give this a shot. Who knows, I may actually enjoy it...</p>
