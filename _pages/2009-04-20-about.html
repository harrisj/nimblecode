My name is Jacob Harris, and I am a Senior Software Architect at the New York Times. This is my personal blog, and so these views are my own and do not represent any official positions of my employer. It may seem stupid to say this, but people have a habit of making the most stupid assumptions about what the Times is doing online, so I have to say it. For most of you, sorry for doubting your intelligence there.
