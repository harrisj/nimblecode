Like so many on the Internet, my online identity is scattered across many websites, so this page provides links to most of them if you want to get a better sense of who I am.

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://nimblecode.com/">My blog</a></dt>
<dd>This is my personal blog. I tend to keep it to technical discussions and I have posted some of my writing in other places, but this gives you an idea.</dd>

<dt><a>Twitter</a></dt>
<dd>Twitter is my main social media outlet. I use Facebook sparingly and Google+ sporadically, but twitter is my daily source to track the exciting and relevant developments in this field.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://harrisj.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a></dt>
<dd>My tumblr is where I track some of the interesting quotes and pictures I find and write some occasional posts too short to be on my blog.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/author/jacob-harris/">The Open Blog</a></dt>
<dd>I helped create this blog for open-source developers at the the <em>Times</em> and those who use our APIs. These are the posts I've written there.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/author/jharris/">Nieman Lab</a></dt>
<dd>Recently, I have written a few short pieces for the Nieman Laboratory in Harvard with a more philosophical exploration of technical subjects.</dd>
