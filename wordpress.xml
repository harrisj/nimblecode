  <title>The Internet and Delivery Services</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This <em>New York Times</em> Article <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/06/dining/06fres.html?ex=1270440000&amp;en=2fa2bbabbf93ca19&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Online Shopping Makes New York a Cardboard Jungle</a></em> has an interesting quote on why FreshDirect has succeeded in delivering online groceries in New York (where I live and am a customer), while so many other delivery services have failed (even in New York)

<blockquote>"New York is an ideal environment for online grocery shopping," said Patti Freeman Evans, a retail analyst for Jupiter Media, an Internet consulting firm. "A time-starved population that is geographically concentrated and Internet-saturated: that's just what you want."</blockquote>

This seems to nail the real reason why many online stores failed during the dot-com boom. If you can make shopping at your site cheaper, easier, and faster than shopping in a brick-and-mortar place (that was still a big if for a lot of places), you still could fail. I imagine a lot of seemingly good business on paper died due to high delivery costs (for nationwide grocery-delivery services; FreshDirect ramped up neighborhood by neighborhood) or because they assumed that too much of their target audience actually wanted to shop for their service on the Internet (or even knew what it was) in the first place.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>When The Web Was New</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/04/wo/wo_040405web.asp">flash from the past</a>, courtesy of <cite>Technology Review</cite>. It's a reprinting of an article about the growing pains of the Web back in 1995. And what's especially funny to me is the screenshot of <a href="http://web.mit.edu">Mit's Homepage</a> back in 1995. If you squint really closely, you can see the address of MIT's official server back then was <code>web.mit.edu</code>, because the domain <code>www.mit.edu</code> was actually the location of an earlier server set up by the esteemed <a href="http://www.mit.edu/sipb/sipb.html">Student Information Processing Board (SIPB)</a>. Originally running on Plexus, a PERL web server implementation, it was one of the first 100 web servers in the world.</p>

<p>Why do I mention this history? Well, back then I was a student at MIT and a prospective member of SIPB, and someone suggested I might want to get involved in <a href="http://stuff.mit.edu/webmasters.html">being a webmaster</a>. And so this has brought on a bit of a wave of nostalgia for those heady really early days when HTML tags were strictly semantic, a URL on a billboard seemed an insane novelty, and we edited pages on the server by hand <em>in ed</em>. Good times.</p>

<p>For more information, check out <a href="http://www.mit.edu/sipb-homepage.html">original 1996-era homepage</a> or the <a href="http://stuff.mit.edu/webmasters.html#history">exciting history</a> of the original MIT web server.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Second day blogging and I am already late to the party in talking about the changes Google has made to the Maps program by incorporating the satellite imagery from Keyhole. The result is very cool, not just because it's neat to see things from space, but because the map functionality is overlaid right onto the satellite data as well (as <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=6744e802-6a07-4507-b952-30cb40684928">John Park shows with his bike route</a>). What I like about this is what I also like about people using the maps with Flickr's annotation capabilities to present <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/memorymap">memory maps</a> or people doing "virtual tourism" of sorts to get a feel of geography from afar, in that there's a real sense of play and fun and hacking going on with Google Maps that I haven't seen with a web service for a while. I will talk more about this later, since I think it's the difference between a successful web service and a dud.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Google Maps and the User Experience</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a> nails one of the reasons why Google Maps has generated such excitement in the last few days with the addition of satellite data. Certainly it's not that the technology is especially new (Microsoft and other companies have had satellite data on the web, and some localities like <a href="http://about.dc.gov/">Washington, DC</a> have provided maps that mix GIS information with aerial views). But the thing about Google Maps that inspires people and creates such a possibility for <em>serious play</em> is the user interface. In <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/04/google-maps-and-user-experience">his post on Google's user experience</a>, Kottke quotes an earlier post with a statement I like so much, I'm going to quote it here:

<blockquote>Advances on the internet and the web are typically heralded as technology-driven. Robert Morris from IBM argued last year at Etech 2002 that -- and I'm paraphrasing from memory here -- most significant advances in software are actually advances in user experience, not in technology. Mosaic was not an advancement in technology over TBL's original browser. Blogger is a highly-specialized FTP client. IM is IRC++ (or IRC for Dummies, depending on your POV). The advantages that these applications offered people were user experience-oriented, not technology-oriented.</blockquote>

<p>Packaging and interface do matter. Indeed, I think the most successful online web applications ultimately will be those with the best interfaces, those that allow people to easily grasp what they can be used for <em>and</em> to dream up new ways to extend their functionality and uses in ways the designers haven't conceived of.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, blogging has been around for a while to be sure. During all these years, I have been steadfast in my disdain and apathy towards blogging, deeming it little more than a way for overly extroverted people to drone on about their lives to what they imagine is a vast and enthralled audience. Which is probably still true, but why am I blogging? </p>

<p>Good question. In my haste to sneer at the writing crowd, I forgot that the appeal of blogging is that it is a simple and democratic communication mechanism, and this is the kicker: <em>communication is both essential for any career and it is often the one thing most holding back software developers like myself from succeeding.</em> Tim Bray of course says it better than me in his post <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/08/BloggingIsGood">Blogging Is Good</a> (a response to the many Blogging Will Get You Fired stories recently).

Most relevant in his top 10 list to me are
<blockquote>No matter how great you are, your career depends on communicating. The way to get better at anything, including communication, is by practicing. Blogging is good practice.</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>Networking is good for your career. Blogging is a good way to meet people.</blockquote>

Well put. Having recently understood the importance of networking and communication for career success (as important if not more so than technical skill), I feel it is time for me to recant my ways and give this a shot. Who knows, I may actually enjoy it...</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Life Hacks For The Rest Of Us</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many technically oriented people, I have been following the recent upsurge of interest in exploring <em>Life Hacks</em> at places like <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a><a> (</a><a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/">wiki</a>), <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">Life Hacker</a>, or <a href="http://www.tradetricks.org/">Tricks of the Trade</a>. And, don't get me wrong, there are some cool tips in there on how to do things, but sometimes it's also easy to feel a bit overwhelmed at some of "Hypergeeky Hints From Heloise" tips given like</p>

<blockquote> Why not "fog proof" the mirror before the shower? Two drops of liquid hand soap (or shower gel) on a folded tissue, apply to the mirror in wide circular motions (if it is a big mirror, you can do just the center part, so you can see at least yourself) until it seems you've done nothing (all the soap disappears). The water vapor will not condensate over the soap unless you take a really long shower</blockquote>

<p>That is why part of me is rather amused to read <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/how_to/the_nonexpert_life_hacks_for_the_rest_of_us.php">Life Hacks for the Rest of Us</a>, a tongue-in-cheek selection of life hacks for people like me. Those who would like to do things better or more efficiently at times, but are often too busy, too lazy, or some combination of both to care. And who aren't above "faking it" sometimes either. Some highlights:</p>

<blockquote>If you claim to have read all the books on your shelves (but you really havenâ€™t), when somebody asks you what a certain (um, unread) book is about or what you thought of it, say â€œIâ€™ll let you find out for yourself,ï¿½? and pressure them to borrow it from you.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>Have a goal you keep telling everyone youâ€™re trying to attain but havenâ€™t yet found the energy or willpower to achieve? Write something that alludes to it (e.g., a plot timeline for your â€œnovelï¿½?) on a piece of paper and tape it to the wall. When your friends see it theyâ€™ll assume youâ€™re striving, which, as we just noted, is half your battle.</blockquote>

are just perfect. Go read the whole thing. While you're at it, also check out 43 Folders' good self parody for April Fools, <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/04/april_power_hac.html">April Power Hacks</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My Dog Hates Computers</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[She tends to paw at me when I dare to work on the laptop instead of scratching her. So, I don't think she'd be into <a href="http://noah.cx/snif/">SNIF</a>, a new project for tracking canine interactions with expensive collars out of the MIT Media Lab (where else?). Yes, this is a fine example of using fancy technology and expensive gadgets to tackle simple problems that aren't begging for solutions. Is it necessary or important? No. But in a city where boutiques sell dog eyeglasses, designer knockoffs, and other expensive dog-oriented options, I suppose it still might sell. From the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,67160,00.html">Wired News article on SNIF</a>, there are some funny excerpts:

<blockquote>The Social Networking in Fur, or SNIF, project is a wearable computer system for dogs that allows their owners to monitor the animals' behavior and capture their social networks.</blockquote>

<p>Paging <a href="http://www.dogster.com/">Dogster</a>, there's some venture capital heading your way! The dog-com boom has started! At least now, I can devote more energy to tracking <a href="www.dogster.com/?26541">Bella's social interactions</a>.

<blockquote>When in the docking station, the leash becomes a display device, alerting users to the status of their pet's social network. If a dog's buddy goes out for a walk, the leash will play the buddy's unique collar tone. "Just as in IM clients, the SNIF hardware makes it easy to know when your dog's pals have gone out for a walk," said Jonathan Gips, one of the SNIF team members. "Instead of being online, your friends are marked as 'outside.'"</blockquote>

<p>I can't really add anything to this. I use this thing called <em>memory</em> to remember which dogs my dog likes, but I'm old-fashioned that way. Of course, I also haven't realized the advantages an advanced electrical device can bring to my bland and depressing existence!

<blockquote>"Psychologically, the pressure to interact socially is lessened by the activity of walking a dog," says Noah Fields, another team member. "Ideally, we want SNIF to function in much the same way. We believe that SNIF will allow dog owners who live hectic lives to use technology to maintain a sense of community."</blockquote>

Yes, if only they could invent communities around dogs playing. Living in Manhattan, I remember going to the dog run, where I could hang out with other dog owners watching out dogs play and thinking to myself, "sure, this may be a community, but if only there were an expensive high-tech way of emulating this system, preferably one that keeps out the poor and unfashionable? When can we reach that golden tomorrow?"]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[She tends to paw at me when I dare to work on the laptop instead of scratching her. So, I don't think she'd be into <a href="http://noah.cx/snif/">SNIF</a>, a new project for tracking canine interactions with expensive collars out of the MIT Media Lab (where else?). Yes, this is a fine example of using fancy technology and expensive gadgets to tackle simple problems that aren't begging for solutions. Is it necessary or important? No. But in a city where boutiques sell dog eyeglasses, designer knockoffs, and other expensive dog-oriented options, I suppose it still might sell. From the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,67160,00.html">Wired News article on SNIF</a>, there are some funny excerpts:

<blockquote>The Social Networking in Fur, or SNIF, project is a wearable computer system for dogs that allows their owners to monitor the animals' behavior and capture their social networks.</blockquote>

<p>Paging <a href="http://www.dogster.com/">Dogster</a>, there's some venture capital heading your way! The dog-com boom has started! At least now, I can devote more energy to tracking <a href="www.dogster.com/?26541">Bella's social interactions</a>.

<blockquote>When in the docking station, the leash becomes a display device, alerting users to the status of their pet's social network. If a dog's buddy goes out for a walk, the leash will play the buddy's unique collar tone. "Just as in IM clients, the SNIF hardware makes it easy to know when your dog's pals have gone out for a walk," said Jonathan Gips, one of the SNIF team members. "Instead of being online, your friends are marked as 'outside.'"</blockquote>

<p>I can't really add anything to this. I use this thing called <em>memory</em> to remember which dogs my dog likes, but I'm old-fashioned that way. Of course, I also haven't realized the advantages an advanced electrical device can bring to my bland and depressing existence!

<blockquote>"Psychologically, the pressure to interact socially is lessened by the activity of walking a dog," says Noah Fields, another team member. "Ideally, we want SNIF to function in much the same way. We believe that SNIF will allow dog owners who live hectic lives to use technology to maintain a sense of community."</blockquote>

Yes, if only they could invent communities around dogs playing. Living in Manhattan, I remember going to the dog run, where I could hang out with other dog owners watching out dogs play and thinking to myself, "sure, this may be a community, but if only there were an expensive high-tech way of emulating this system, preferably one that keeps out the poor and unfashionable? When can we reach that golden tomorrow?"]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>For the love of dog, stick with the dog park and good old fashioned memory (as if a dog forgets a friend&#8217;s scent anyway?) Dogster is just here for when you&#8217;re stuck behind the computer!</p>


	<p>I think the <span class="caps">SNIF</span> thing is one of those things that only makes sense as an academic study that then gets picked up by the press due to nifty graphics and not glossed-over details.</p>


	<p>However, if it could be mass produced at a really cheap price it would be fun to connect the <span class="caps">SNIF</span> data to dogster profiles and then map out who happened to be near who. (If you&#8217;re the trusting type ;)</p>


	<p>PS: I love the dog-com pun. Woof!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hello Dogster! Thanks for the comments! Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Dogster actually. It has all the hallmarks of fun, nimble technology. Basically, what I like about Dogster is what I used to like about Friendster and I do like about Flickr, Google Maps etc. in that it&#8217;s a wonderful example of building a community by creating a place from the ground up, and encouraging people to play with it. People don&#8217;t come to Dogster because it&#8217;s better than the park, they come there because it&#8217;s a fun complement to their lives. Plus, you don&#8217;t charge people to add their pooches.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps it&#8217;s unfair, but the same sense I get from <span class="caps">SNIF</span> is the sense I got from those Doggie Translators and the Dog Cell Phones. &#8220;This is the product, this is how you will use it&#8230; and it seems like it&#8217;s still going to be a bit of a pricey technology that will keep many people away.</p>


	<p>Anyhow, thanks for the feedback. And good luck making your dog-com millions!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Google Maps And The Transparent Society</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, after the initial excitement over Google Maps had died down, the mounting concerns over user privacy were inevitable. Some of these have been <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/001238.html">quite clever</a>, but I imagine there are other bloggers out there seriously concerned about the evil swarm of satellites spying on them. Have we reached an Orwellian future where our every motion is tracked?

<p>Relax. I think not. For starters, as people have noted, a satellite taking photos of your patch of sod every six months is hardly a threat to your autonomy. If anything, your privacy is probably more threatened by the myriad private cameras <a href="http://www.mediaeater.com/cameras/">monitoring your city's streets</a>, not to mention the large dossiers compiled by (and stolen from) credit reporting agencies and personal databases like LexisNexis or Choicepoint. At least with Google Maps, the people are still in control. Indeed, I think there is a profound difference between a society where a powerful few control the cameras (ie, Orwell's police state) and one where any of us can look through the viewfinder. As <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000710.html">Jeffrey Veen notes</a>

<blockquote>Ultimately Orwell was right: everything we do will be watched. But he was wrong about the government building it. We did it ourselves. Which means where Matt sees chemistry, I see environmental accountability. Where others see surveillance, I see corporate whistle-blowing. It reminds me of the Surfrider Foundation's project to get kayakers in the San Francisco Bay to cameraphone the bilge coming out out of container ships. What happens when thousands of grassroots activists can click-and-drag through the remote places in this country? Clearcut! Oil spill! You can't dump that there -- we're watching!</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, this seems to be a clear benefit of opening satellite views to all. An ordinary person doesn't really do anything significant enough to be seen from outer space. But, lots of corporations and governments and other massive entities do. And where normally they could hide their various deeds in remote places fenced off from the outside world and spun away by crack PR efforts, they still can be seen by satellite. For example, be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2005/04/07/google_maps_/">the look of clearcutting in British Columbia</a>, described by Mezzoblue:

<blockquote>A picture is worth a thousand words and all that, so hereâ€™s a 4000 word essay on what the forestry industry is doing in British Columbia, as of whatever the date was when the satellite snapped these.</blockquote>

I must interject here that I find it amazing that I can examine the effects of the forestry industry in Vancouver without leaving my desk in New York. Maybe there is something to old dot-com boom adage that the Internet obliterates geography! Getting back on topic though, this discussion of uses leads back to the most important question about any spying technology. <em>Who</em> is doing the spying is much more important than <em>what</em> they are spying on. That is the point made by David Brin in his essay (and subsequent book) <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.12/fftransparent.html">The Transparent Society</a> back in 1997. Assuming that we can keep cameras out of people's home (a bad thing all around), we have to pretty much accept the fact that the technologies of surveillance are proliferating in public spaces. So, he posits there is really a choice between two societies:

<ol>
<li>The Orwellian nightmare state where the cameras are manned by a vigilant and arbitary police force</li>
<li>The transparent society, where anybody can look through any camera</li>
</ol>

<p>Why is the second choice better? Perhaps these environmentalist examples with Google Maps illustrate that nicely. It is just that much harder for secrets and corruption to flourish in such a system (hence the <em>transparent</em> in the name), and the technology helps to empower the citizen rather to suppress him. Now, I am no technological utopianist or wild-eyed cypherpunk, and I would prefer a society without widespread surveillance of course. But if it is coming (and it is), I think the more transparent we can make it, the better our future will be.]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In my previous post where I criticized the <a href="/blog/?p=11">SNIF device for mapping pet social networks</a> as being a solution in search of a problem, I wrote a snide aside about it originating from the MIT Media Lab (where else?). Okay, I will admit it, that was mean. The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a> does come up with some great ideas too. For instance, check out this design for <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/resenv/Self-Powered-Switch/index.html">a remote control that is powered by pushing the buttons</a> (via the wonderful <a href="http://makezine.com/blog/">Make Magazine Blog</a>. This is so simple but brilliant (think how many batteries just go into remote controls every year), that I feel I owe the Media Lab a bit of an apology on the strength of that one invention alone. And they do lots of other neat stuff too. I even took a few classes in holography there while I was a student at MIT.

<p>Still, I feel I must explore the source of my snarkiness. The nature of the Media Lab is that their projects are driven by corporate funding, and so there is often a sheen of hype over everything they do (no sponsor wants to feel like they're paying for a dud). They really have to sell themselves to the sponsors. So, the resulting perception among engineers is this sense of undifferentiated breathlessness where the most speculative and profoundly silly projects are treated with the same reverences as ideas profound and smart. Furthermore, the hype practically screams out the belief that <em>everything</em> will be a wild success and that <em>everything</em> can be improved by technology. It's like we've learned no lessons from the dot-com bust. And this hype is what gets me surly, because I've been down that road before.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In my previous post where I criticized the <a href="/blog/?p=11">SNIF device for mapping pet social networks</a> as being a solution in search of a problem, I wrote a snide aside about it originating from the MIT Media Lab (where else?). Okay, I will admit it, that was mean. The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a> does come up with some great ideas too. For instance, check out this design for <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/resenv/Self-Powered-Switch/index.html">a remote control that is powered by pushing the buttons</a> (via the wonderful <a href="http://makezine.com/blog/">Make Magazine Blog</a>. This is so simple but brilliant (think how many batteries just go into remote controls every year), that I feel I owe the Media Lab a bit of an apology on the strength of that one invention alone. And they do lots of other neat stuff too. I even took a few classes in holography there while I was a student at MIT.

<p>Still, I feel I must explore the source of my snarkiness. The nature of the Media Lab is that their projects are driven by corporate funding, and so there is often a sheen of hype over everything they do (no sponsor wants to feel like they're paying for a dud). They really have to sell themselves to the sponsors. So, the resulting perception among engineers is this sense of undifferentiated breathlessness where the most speculative and profoundly silly projects are treated with the same reverences as ideas profound and smart. Furthermore, the hype practically screams out the belief that <em>everything</em> will be a wild success and that <em>everything</em> can be improved by technology. It's like we've learned no lessons from the dot-com bust. And this hype is what gets me surly, because I've been down that road before.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I completely missed the 5-year anniversary of when the tech-boom bubble started to go south. Looking back, we all knew that the bubble would eventually burst, but a lot of people lost their shirts anyway hoping to get out at the optimum time (essentially like surfing a cresting wave). For those of you who may not have experience the wave of euphoria and techno-optimism that filled those days, visiting Om Malik's compendium of links to reminiscences is a good start. Here's a good quote from <a href="http://www.gigaom.com/2005/03/10/five-years-after-the-bubble/">Five Years After The Bubble</a>:

<blockquote>Still, it was fun. The parties on the roof top of The Industry Standard, the Red Herring conferences, and of course the launch parties. Ahh.. the parties. Five years later, I realize that I lived through one of the most fantastic bubbles in the history of man. Enough, to turn any sane journalist cynical, an occupational hazard when you write about technology, its possibilities and of course its life changing potential. I worried that I was becoming too cynical and losing my love for the biz I love: technology.</blockquote>

Yes, it all seems so silly now. Working at an unglamorous startup (<em>so unglamorous we've actually been making money!</em>) here in New York, I wasn't really making the rounds from party to party like people did in San Francisco. But the stories would get out and be reported breathless of course in Wired and other places, so I read about it: the $5 million bashes, the super bowl ads, the hot bands flown in for private gigs while nerds enjoyed their brief limelight. We all felt so cool, nerds were running the show, and we were going to change everything (hopefully in a manner as badass as the first Matrix movie too). But, it was really just an elaborate con in some sense, since old media still got the last laugh. In effect, the whole dot-com boom could be written up as a huge transfer of wealth from the computer industry to the media industry (which is why the AOL-TimeWarner merger was so misguided). It's really hard to avoid the inevitable metaphorical comparison to the Titanic, but I'm going to spare you that at least.

I do remember hearing about one party that really confirmed to me that the bubble had taken on a crazy life of its own. There was a startup from SF advertising everywhere here in New York called Modo that was going to market electronic entertainment guides for the hip tech-savvy crowd. If you've seen <a href="http://www.vindigo.com">Vindigo</a> for the Palm, the concept should be recognizable. But, instead of operating on an existing device like cell phones or Palms, they wanted to sell a $99 device at high-end stores like DKNY, Virgin, etc. in an attempt to woo fashionistas and the difficult hipster market to tech (usually a fruitless effort). Anyway, to cut a long story short, by the time they reached their launch party, the company had already <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2000/10/25/1025modo.html">burned through $40 million in Venture Capital</a> ($20 million gone to advertising) and gone out of business. And so, their launch party became a wake. Unbelievable, but that's pretty much how it happened in many places, and I am thankful we managed to ride out the Internet crash in one piece ourselves (more on that later).</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Radical Simplification</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Heinemeier Hansson has posted an interested find over at his blog <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">Loud Thinking</a> about <span class="caps">IBM</span>&#8217;s stated new goal to pursue <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000439.html">Radical Simplification</a> in their enterprise work. Essentially, Big Blue is starting to acknowledge that most enterprise web development is just too cumbersome and daunting for agile and powerful web development. Things like <span class="caps">SOAP</span> and <span class="caps">WSDL</span> are examples of this. What should be a simple task like <em>retrieve a weather forecast from a remote site</em> becomes a complicated mess of debugging <span class="caps">SOAP</span> calls, tweaking <span class="caps">WSDL</span> specifications and using wizards on the server to generate code that is impossible for the end user to debug, let alone understand.</p>


	<p>Or as Sam Ruby puts in his excellent presentation to <span class="caps">IBM</span> on the topic <a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/rs/">Hello From The Open Source World</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>For normal people, the perceived usefulness of a computer language is inversely proportional to the amount of theory the language forces you to learn.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Sam illustrates this in his slides by showing the classic &#8220;Hello World&#8221; example in a variety of programming languages on different slides. But when he reaches <span class="caps">WSDL</span> to specify it, it&#8217;s a blank. Because, quite frankly, <span class="caps">WSDL</span> is so unwieldy to use, it&#8217;s hard to just build it on the fly, forcing many people to plunk down bucks to Microsoft or <span class="caps">IBM</span> to get their compilers to build it for them. It&#8217;s good business for those companies, but bad news for the Internet as a whole I think.</p>


	<p>Ruby says that essentially for a framework to succeed on the web, it has to enable a situation he terms <strong>Zero Training</strong>, a state where it is easy to get going in the language and to adapt examples to your own needs. Good programming languages have it, some web technologies have it, <span class="caps">SOAP</span> and <span class="caps">WSDL</span> don&#8217;t. Indeed, I feel like the growth of <span class="caps">SOAP</span>/WSDL in the enterprise has been in spite of the difficulties of developing for it (mainly because of Microsoft and <span class="caps">IBM</span> pushing it). Because, quite frankly, it&#8217;s a beast for anything but the most basic <span class="caps">RPC</span>-style calls. The reasons:</p>


	<ol>
	<li><span class="caps">SOAP</span> allows you to abstract away the underlying transport protocol. But for 99% of <span class="caps">SOAP</span> communication, this protocol is <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, and the abstraction limits the control you have over <span class="caps">HTTP</span>.</li>
		<li><span class="caps">SOAP</span> needs to validate the entire message before applications can operate on it. This usually means it has to load it up into a <span class="caps">DOM</span> as well, so calls that return lots of data or might take a while (<em>the fun ones</em>) are frowned upon</li>
		<li><span class="caps">SOAP</span> also assumes the <span class="caps">COM</span>/CORBA marshalling mechanism, so no streaming data or parsing data until the entire document has been received, parsed into an <span class="caps">XML DOM</span> tree, and then mapped into an in-memory object tree. For large amounts of data, forget it.</li>
		<li><span class="caps">WSDL</span> has a lot of syntax to map procedure names/arguments onto <span class="caps">HTTP</span>. Contrast this to <span class="caps">REST</span>, which embraces the inherent naming conventions of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> and applies them to a simple procedural call model</li>
		<li>The assumption of these tools is that you will use their <span class="caps">SOAP</span> wizards instead of rolling your own code. The wizard is meant to be the only way, not an additional way.</li>
		<li>In fact, the idea that <span class="caps">SOAP </span>= Simple Object Access Protocol has become a profound irony.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>In his presentation, Mr. Ruby points to <span class="caps">PHP</span> as an alternate model. <span class="caps">PHP</span> is not really a pretty programming model and it tends to shy away from enforcing higher-level abstractions in favor of lower-level models. But, it is precisely for this reason that <span class="caps">PHP</span> has succeeded where many other dynamic web application programming models have failed. Indeed, as it says in the page <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/php_experts/rasmus_php.html">Do You <span class="caps">PHP</span>?</a></p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Database abstraction is mostly a myth. There is nothing wrong with direct database calls&#8217; making use of all the tricks and cheats your chosen database has to offer, to tweak as much performance as possible out of it.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>And this is the kicker here. Complicated database models tend to abstract away the lower level details of individual databases, even when those details can be the difference between fast and sluggish performance. Remote invocation models like <span class="caps">SOAP</span> abstract away the details of the underlying calling mechanism, even when tweaking <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests can be the difference between a fast web app and a slow one. The lower-level mechanism might require more work for the developer, it might be ugly as sin, and it might be wrong and inefficient on some levels, but it works, and more importantly, it works <em>quickly</em>. Because ultimately, the customer doesn&#8217;t care what technology is used on the backend, they just want their data fast.</p>


	<p>Bringing it back to my own experience, I once had to work on an application where we searched a remote document repository via <span class="caps">SOAP</span> and got metadata back on matching documents in <span class="caps">XML</span>. The service would send back all matching results for a query and in some cases, this would result in returning 150000 documents over 5 minutes of streaming <span class="caps">XML</span> to us. Knowing that the user probably would want to see data as quickly as possible, I decided it would be good to render whatever data I got after I received 10000 documents and tell the user to perhaps narrow their search down. And I tried to do this in <span class="caps">SOAP</span> in Visual Studio, and I failed. I could error out completely, but the mechanism had abstracted away the underlying <span class="caps">XML</span>-over-HTTP communication that I had no hooks to get lower level.</p>


	<p>And so, I chucked it out and went back to basics. The upcoming call to the remote service was faked by filling in an <span class="caps">XML</span> string I grabbed from the original <span class="caps">SOAP</span> call via a packet sniffer. On the return, my program screams through the data with stream-based <span class="caps">XML</span> parsing. Once I hit 10000 records, then I can stop reading the input stream, display what I have, and tell the user that they need to narrow their search criteria. All within 30 seconds.</p>


	<p>Those people who use <span class="caps">SOAP</span> are probably horrified by this and would rightly point out that I had to do a lot of lower-level work to get some of the same functionality promised by the one-click higher-level <span class="caps">SOAP</span> abstraction. But I think that&#8217;s precisely the problem. I needed something to work, and I didn&#8217;t need as much for it to be pretty. The <span class="caps">SOAP</span> framework locked me into a particular model, and once I needed more than that, it failed to deliver. Abstraction is nice, but abstraction always reduces speed, abstraction always reduces flexbility. In most cases, it is possible to strike a balance where the abstraction helps more than it hurts, but until <span class="caps">SOAP</span> is able to handle the heavy lifting needed for serious web work, it isn&#8217;t worth my time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>David Heinemeier Hansson has posted an interested find over at his blog <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">Loud Thinking</a> about <span class="caps">IBM</span>&#8217;s stated new goal to pursue <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000439.html">Radical Simplification</a> in their enterprise work. Essentially, Big Blue is starting to acknowledge that most enterprise web development is just too cumbersome and daunting for agile and powerful web development. Things like <span class="caps">SOAP</span> and <span class="caps">WSDL</span> are examples of this. What should be a simple task like <em>retrieve a weather forecast from a remote site</em> becomes a complicated mess of debugging <span class="caps">SOAP</span> calls, tweaking <span class="caps">WSDL</span> specifications and using wizards on the server to generate code that is impossible for the end user to debug, let alone understand.</p>


	<p>Or as Sam Ruby puts in his excellent presentation to <span class="caps">IBM</span> on the topic <a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/rs/">Hello From The Open Source World</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>For normal people, the perceived usefulness of a computer language is inversely proportional to the amount of theory the language forces you to learn.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Sam illustrates this in his slides by showing the classic &#8220;Hello World&#8221; example in a variety of programming languages on different slides. But when he reaches <span class="caps">WSDL</span> to specify it, it&#8217;s a blank. Because, quite frankly, <span class="caps">WSDL</span> is so unwieldy to use, it&#8217;s hard to just build it on the fly, forcing many people to plunk down bucks to Microsoft or <span class="caps">IBM</span> to get their compilers to build it for them. It&#8217;s good business for those companies, but bad news for the Internet as a whole I think.</p>


	<p>Ruby says that essentially for a framework to succeed on the web, it has to enable a situation he terms <strong>Zero Training</strong>, a state where it is easy to get going in the language and to adapt examples to your own needs. Good programming languages have it, some web technologies have it, <span class="caps">SOAP</span> and <span class="caps">WSDL</span> don&#8217;t. Indeed, I feel like the growth of <span class="caps">SOAP</span>/WSDL in the enterprise has been in spite of the difficulties of developing for it (mainly because of Microsoft and <span class="caps">IBM</span> pushing it). Because, quite frankly, it&#8217;s a beast for anything but the most basic <span class="caps">RPC</span>-style calls. The reasons:</p>


	<ol>
	<li><span class="caps">SOAP</span> allows you to abstract away the underlying transport protocol. But for 99% of <span class="caps">SOAP</span> communication, this protocol is <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, and the abstraction limits the control you have over <span class="caps">HTTP</span>.</li>
		<li><span class="caps">SOAP</span> needs to validate the entire message before applications can operate on it. This usually means it has to load it up into a <span class="caps">DOM</span> as well, so calls that return lots of data or might take a while (<em>the fun ones</em>) are frowned upon</li>
		<li><span class="caps">SOAP</span> also assumes the <span class="caps">COM</span>/CORBA marshalling mechanism, so no streaming data or parsing data until the entire document has been received, parsed into an <span class="caps">XML DOM</span> tree, and then mapped into an in-memory object tree. For large amounts of data, forget it.</li>
		<li><span class="caps">WSDL</span> has a lot of syntax to map procedure names/arguments onto <span class="caps">HTTP</span>. Contrast this to <span class="caps">REST</span>, which embraces the inherent naming conventions of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> and applies them to a simple procedural call model</li>
		<li>The assumption of these tools is that you will use their <span class="caps">SOAP</span> wizards instead of rolling your own code. The wizard is meant to be the only way, not an additional way.</li>
		<li>In fact, the idea that <span class="caps">SOAP </span>= Simple Object Access Protocol has become a profound irony.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>In his presentation, Mr. Ruby points to <span class="caps">PHP</span> as an alternate model. <span class="caps">PHP</span> is not really a pretty programming model and it tends to shy away from enforcing higher-level abstractions in favor of lower-level models. But, it is precisely for this reason that <span class="caps">PHP</span> has succeeded where many other dynamic web application programming models have failed. Indeed, as it says in the page <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/php_experts/rasmus_php.html">Do You <span class="caps">PHP</span>?</a></p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Database abstraction is mostly a myth. There is nothing wrong with direct database calls&#8217; making use of all the tricks and cheats your chosen database has to offer, to tweak as much performance as possible out of it.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>And this is the kicker here. Complicated database models tend to abstract away the lower level details of individual databases, even when those details can be the difference between fast and sluggish performance. Remote invocation models like <span class="caps">SOAP</span> abstract away the details of the underlying calling mechanism, even when tweaking <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests can be the difference between a fast web app and a slow one. The lower-level mechanism might require more work for the developer, it might be ugly as sin, and it might be wrong and inefficient on some levels, but it works, and more importantly, it works <em>quickly</em>. Because ultimately, the customer doesn&#8217;t care what technology is used on the backend, they just want their data fast.</p>


	<p>Bringing it back to my own experience, I once had to work on an application where we searched a remote document repository via <span class="caps">SOAP</span> and got metadata back on matching documents in <span class="caps">XML</span>. The service would send back all matching results for a query and in some cases, this would result in returning 150000 documents over 5 minutes of streaming <span class="caps">XML</span> to us. Knowing that the user probably would want to see data as quickly as possible, I decided it would be good to render whatever data I got after I received 10000 documents and tell the user to perhaps narrow their search down. And I tried to do this in <span class="caps">SOAP</span> in Visual Studio, and I failed. I could error out completely, but the mechanism had abstracted away the underlying <span class="caps">XML</span>-over-HTTP communication that I had no hooks to get lower level.</p>


	<p>And so, I chucked it out and went back to basics. The upcoming call to the remote service was faked by filling in an <span class="caps">XML</span> string I grabbed from the original <span class="caps">SOAP</span> call via a packet sniffer. On the return, my program screams through the data with stream-based <span class="caps">XML</span> parsing. Once I hit 10000 records, then I can stop reading the input stream, display what I have, and tell the user that they need to narrow their search criteria. All within 30 seconds.</p>


	<p>Those people who use <span class="caps">SOAP</span> are probably horrified by this and would rightly point out that I had to do a lot of lower-level work to get some of the same functionality promised by the one-click higher-level <span class="caps">SOAP</span> abstraction. But I think that&#8217;s precisely the problem. I needed something to work, and I didn&#8217;t need as much for it to be pretty. The <span class="caps">SOAP</span> framework locked me into a particular model, and once I needed more than that, it failed to deliver. Abstraction is nice, but abstraction always reduces speed, abstraction always reduces flexbility. In most cases, it is possible to strike a balance where the abstraction helps more than it hurts, but until <span class="caps">SOAP</span> is able to handle the heavy lifting needed for serious web work, it isn&#8217;t worth my time.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Jeffrey Zeldman coins this lovely phrase in a mild criticism of tag clouds (see <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0405d.shtml">Tag Clouds Are The New Mullets</a>) as the new senstation that's sweeping the nation:

<blockquote>Like mood rings and fanny packs, like mullets and the Macarena, the weighted tag clouds meme popularized by Flickr and Technorati is about to cross a permanent cultural shame threshold. Brilliant as the idea remains, faddishness is choking its air supply. Damned clouds are everywhere.</blockquote>

A tag cloud is one of those displays where they'll have a bunch of one-word tags as links and each link is sized based on how popular it is (more popular = larger font) You've probably seen them on places like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/">Flickr</a> or <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/">Del.icio.us</a>. The problem snarkily alluded here by Zeldman is that tag clouds (like your favorite indie band) are not as cool when everybody knows about them, and it is dead certain you will see them sprouting up more and more, including commercial sites.

The thing is, I don't personally think they are that brilliant. I'm no visual designer (paging <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/">Edward Tufte</a>), but something seems to be missing for me. I know they are visually arresting and can provide a high-level view of comparative popularity, but looking at the things often gives me a real headache too. I would argue it's actually harder to find less-popular items in a tag cloud than it would be in an unadorned list (seeing the forest for the trees). And in accessibility terms, it's still no better than an ordered list with counts. For small lists, they're pointless and for large lists I find it easier to scroll down vertically than read down and across. I think there is a better interface out there and perhaps it will take the faddishness of tag clouds to give us the necessary backlash for something new.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The digerati are all abuzz about Fred Wilson's recent seed funding for <a href="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, the popular social bookmarking/tagging service. What's especially interesting is that Fred himself concedes he has no real idea of what the business plan for his new investment might be (see <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/04/delicious.html">Funding Del.icio.us</a>):

<blockquote>The question everyone asks is "what is the business model".  To be completely and totally honest, we don't yet know.  This was a seed investment and none of the investors put up very much capital.  Joshua retained complete control of the service and is going to focus on making it better.  That is all anyone wants to see happen right now.  In time it will become clear what the business model should be.  And there are a number of them to choose from for sure.</blockquote>

Now, this has attracted <a href="http://www.gawker.com/news/media/internet/nyc-vcs-get-their-mojo-back-040203.php">some snarkiness and derision</a> from those of us who remember the dot-com boom and the days the hype subsequently died. But I think Fred Wilson is acting smart here. It's hardly a stretch to see that del.icio.us is a wonderful nimble platform for people to build things and there are some great web technologies at work behind the scenes too. It is becoming more feasible to work within a browser and choose sites like you would normally evaluate software packages. So, it's easy to see that Del.icio.us is likely to become part of the future user's toolset (like word processors and such today) and I think Fred's seed investment is mainly to ensure that when that big thing happens he has VIP access.

<p>I found this entry of Seth Goldstein <a href="http://majestic.typepad.com/seth/2005/04/media_futures_p.html">Media Futures: Alchemy</a> to have an excellent analysis of why sites like del.icio.us might turn out to be more than just toys in the long run (it's also where I got the quote in the title about del.icio.us). Seth seems to be a very smart guy, and he is the person who introduced Joshua Schachter, the creator of del.icio.us to Fred Wilson:

<blockquote>This is consistent with what I see happening online, where meta-data (information about information) is creating significant economic value, from the many millions of Google and Overture keywords to the emerging class of Flickr, Del.icio.us and other tag-driven systems.  Our browsing, clicking, searching and tagging behavior are the base metals which alchemists like Josh are turning into precious datastores.</blockquote>

I would underscore that what we are seeing here is a change in the Internet model of consumers. In the early days, the idea was that advertising revenue would drive the business and consumers were valued as passive <em>eyeballs</em>, essentially a broadcast model in a new medium. But as we have seen in Wikipedia, with Flickr, and with Del.icio.us, there is real stickiness in sites that let users create, moderate, and control the content. And there is a real market for services that allow people to manage the metadata for things in their lives without imposing extra restrictions. So, Flickr makes photo sharing and classification easy, but more importantly, it makes it <em>fun</em>. Ditto with del.icio.us for bookmarks. Yes, eyeballs are still important, but I think part of the Web2.0 experience is valuing the brains of the user as well.

<p>Of course, Seth has noted all this too and suggests "it would seem that there is simply no way to create long term sustainable value online without engaging consumers in the act of media production." And yet, he notes that even the seemingly open players like Yahoo and Google are creating their own complementary suites of products so that users are limited to creating only within a particular company's sites. Will this turn the web into another AOL vs. Prodigy situation, or will there be independent and cross-provider toolsets for us to use? I suppose time will tell.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week saw the intriguing web mashups of combining two popular web services in one place. So, first there was <a href="http://www.paulrademacher.com/housing/">combining Craigslist Real Estate listings with Google Maps</a>, which although slow is really quite amazing to behold. Then someone else hacked <a href="http://llimllib.f2o.org/blog/serve/entry/delbackup">Gmail + Del.icio.us</a>, using Google's mail service to capture contents on bookmarked pages at the bookmarking time. Not to mention <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2005/04/19/0216">Adrian's trailblazing mix of Google Maps and Chicago transit info</a>.

<p>All of these are amusing and technically well-executed hacks, but what is most amazing to me is not the front-end combinations, but the ease in which it is possible to mix web tools in the back end to create new powerful services. And I have been especially struck by how SOAP has been utterly unnecessary for this to happen. In fact, I would argue that the strict COM-style model of SOAP is exactly the problem here, in that SOAP requires such effort and planning, it resists such freeform discovery of capabilities beyond what the creators of products imagine. REST seems to have a natural advantage here in that it builds on the inherent procedural model of HTTP and thus can evolve as naturally as websites do. Combine that with dynamic HTML tricks and we can see how nimble code can outmaneuver the heavyweight mechanics of SOAP again and again.

  <title>Folksonomy Needs Taxonomy</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2005/05/11/folksonomy-needs-taxonomy/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In an <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0505a.shtml">excellent followup</a> to his <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0405d.shtml">earlier post on the problem with tag clouds</a>, Jeffrey Zeldman looks at tag clouds a bit more critically and reaches similar conclusions to my own <a href="/blog/?p=18">concerns about tagging and design</a> (<em>If you don't know what a tag cloud is, <a href="http://yahoo.theherrens.com/index.php">here's a good example</a>)</em>:

<blockquote>Tag clouds remove the guidance and artistry from our side of the equation, offloading all the work to our users. Whatâ€™s popular? Whatâ€™s important? Users decide. This might be okay if the process did not create a false intellectual equivalence between high- and low-level topics, and if it did not skew toward popularity at the expense of findability.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As tag clouds come to replace expert taxonomies in common practice, carefully constructed hierarchies vanish. In their place is a flattened world where every idea, at any level, is a topic as worthy as any other. Eight Mile is a topic at the same level as Detroit, which is a topic at the same level as Cities, which is a topic at the same level as United States, and so on.</blockquote>

Which is an excellent point I neglected to touch on. The truth is, <strong>hierarchies are powerful</strong>. For instance, when it comes to geography we have generally accepted and useful geographical hierarchies like so:

<blockquote>Earth &rarr; North America &rarr; United States &rarr; New York State &rarr; New York City &rarr; Brooklyn &rarr; street address OR latitude/longitude</blockquote>

<p>And by thinking of things this way we can easily control the level of detail (and the number of matches for a search) by moving up and down the scale. Which is why <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> has the useful slider on the left. The problem with tagging is that it has no hierarchy. <b>Even worse is that tagging can sometimes imply a hierarchy that it doesn't support.</b> To see why this might be a problem, imagine I tag a photo "Eight Mile" like in Jeffrey Zeldman's example above. most people would also expect it to show up if you searched for photos of "Detroit", but it won't since I didn't tag it at that hierarchy. So, I've broken search just like that, in that I force the user to adapt to the system rather than handle search requests (imagine having to find photos of New York by doing searches like "(new york) OR (brooklyn) OR (empire state building) OR (statue of liberty) OR...", but that's the only option available if we discard taxonomies. And this quite frankly sucks. It's ambiguous (lots of errors) and even worse, assuming you could get your query perfect, it's so very slow. </p>

<p>Of course, there are areas where taxonomies can be nuisances too. But taxonomies are perfect for navigation, because they mirror the way we structure our knowledge of the world. And while folksonomies are great for filling in additional details, a site that relies on them exclusively is a nightmare to navigate because there is no starting point for me to narrow down from and no way of knowing that any view is comprehensive for all the things I think should be in there. Folksonomy needs taxonomy to create a logical sense of things and how they relate, and taxonomy needs folksonomy to handle new content and additional information that taxonomy is too rigid to use.</p>

<p><em>As an aside, perhaps this realization about the navigational shortcomings of a pure folksonomy scheme is behind the sudden interest in geotagging Flickr photos with latitude/longitude (see <a href="http://geobloggers.com/">Geobloggers</a> for an example of this). Essentially, latitude/longitude is just the lowest level in a geography taxonomy and by using a consistent markup, it's essentially the same as if Flickr provided a positional hierarchy of its own).</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Steps I have taken trying to download the updated VPN client for Cisco firewalls

<ol>
<li>Click on link to download from VersionTrackers, gets login form</li>
<li>Fills out a 4-page registration form to get an account</li>
<li>Waits 20 minutes for an email confirming the account to arrive</li>
<li>Click on activation link to activate. Try to search for VPN software. Search functionality is awful</li>
<li>Go back to original link, enter username &amp; password; informed that account not found</li>
<li>Click on activation link again. Login successfully I think, but taken to Cisco front page where there is no indication I've logged in.</li>
<li>Find an indication I am apparently logged in with a guest status and need to provide more information to get access but no indication of what that information is.</li>
<li>Find the location for Cisco VPN software in the tree navigation finally. Then click on a link to Downloads (aha!) only to be told "You are either not logged in, or you are currently visiting this page with public or guest access."
</li></ol>

And this is where I give up briefly because I have real work to do. Honestly, can anybody explain why Cisco's website sucks so horribly? I know there might be export controls for some of their software, but I just want to get an update for their VPN software for my operating system, an update that is late considering they've had months to work on it, and their stupid website keeps getting in the way of what I want to do.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I can't explain why their web site sucks so horribly. I can share a similar story, though.

My Cisco RV042 router offers a service called "ProtectLink Gateway" which appears to be a firewall that will protect my entire network from rogue web sites and other online threats. Sounds great! I click the "Go Buy" button from my router's configuration tool.

I'm expecting to see the typical "Buy It Now" page. If the price is right, I'm ready to enter my credit card number!

Instead, I get a page that lists descriptions for three related products. One of those is "ProtectLink Gateway" but there are no links or buttons to buy it, just a bulleted list of three of its features.

There's a small titled "Cisco ProtectLink Gateway" - Click! More bullets about its features. A "Compare Licenses" link! Okay... more bullets... a lot of good features! How much is it? I'm ready to order! The only link is "Secure My Business." Nope, that tells me about online dangers and why I need Cisco to secure my business. Back button! Back button again!

I click "Download Software" at the top of the page. Now I have to select a product. I have the "Cisco RV042 Router". Not listed. There are six products listed and all have cryptic names like "Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances". Back button!

Okay, "Maintain and Operate"? Maybe that includes purchasing a license? Nope. That's for downloading "Maintain and Operate Guides". Back button!

"Products and Services?" Nope, that lists all of the things that I can buy from Cisco. Back button.

Getting desperate now, I click "Find a Reseller," hoping that their web site will have more information. Enter my zip code and, oops! No resellers are available. Don't they have any online resellers? I even tried searching Albany, NY. No resellers there, either. No option to expand the distance that I'm willing to search.

Back button.

Now I get the pop-up asking if I want to chat with someone. What do I have to lose?

Here is an abbreviated version of the chat:
Anthony: How may I assist you?
Me: I am interested in ProtectLink Gateway for my RV042 router but I can't figure out how much it costs.
Anthony: Do you have the router already?
Me: Yes.
Anthony: Let me check for the pricing.
Me: Thank you.
Anthony: What prompted you to look into this?
Me: I explain about problems with rogue web sites.
Anthony: Thank you. One moment please.
- several minutes pass -
Anthony: Sorry for the long wait. I did not find the information you need. I can refer you to a local Cisco partner.
- skipping questions to find a partner -
Anthony: Do you have other network projects?
Anthony: Are there other upgrade plans in the next 12 months?
Me: No.
Anthony: Still checking for a partner. How soon are you planning to implement this?
Me: If the price is reasonable, immediately.
Anthony: If possible, you will be purchasing today?
Me: Yes.
Anthony: - provided name and phone number of Cisco partner -
Anthony: I will also send your information to them and they will contact you.

He seemed to have missed the, "Would you like me to have them contact you?" question. The entire chat took about 10-15 minutes. Oh well. I'm really not interested anymore. If it takes this much work just to find a price can you imagine what will happen when it's blocking every web site I try to go to, even the good ones, and I can't figure out how to turn it off? I'll be weeks just trying to find someone who can help me.

Thanks, Cisco. You're obviously trying! You have a ton of information and links. You just need to figure out what's important and put that on your web site. This is even worse than HP's small business web site.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Intel Inside the Mac</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Because the world doesn't have enough blog analysis on this topic already, I figure I'll wade into the fray with a few points I haven't noticed elsewhere yet (in pithy bullet form!). <strong>Update:</strong> I've decided to add some links to the best analysis I've seen so far.

<ul>
<li>Like most mac-heads, I must admit I feel a bit dismayed at Steve Jobs having a love fest with Intel. At the very least, I was hoping for AMD or someone else instead, but Intel? Ah well, I guess we'll get used to it.</li>
<li>Don't panic yet though. Although there will be an x86 inside, Apple is not abandoning making Macs. I imagine you won't be able to install OS X on any PC. Apple is still a hardware company and still wants to control every aspect of the machine. It will still have a Mac ROM, still boot with OpenFirmware and still have a paltry choice of video cards. It's limited I know, but I think the control that Apple has over the underlying hardware really helps to make OS X a better experience.</li>
<li>Processing power matters. Apple has managed to do more with less by doing things gracefully, but that only goes so far. To really get into the media center business, particularly the HDTV home consumer market, the Mini needs more horsepower. Heat dissipation is going to be a challenge though.</li>
<li>Some have said the crucial point behind the switch is the Pentium D's Digital Rights Management capabilities. Leander Kahney thinks this will be key for Apple wooing Hollywood studios for digital movie content, but I must lament that it will someday be impossible to find hardware without DRM built in.</li>
<li>I guess Windows emulation will be a whole lot faster now.</li>
<li>Although Apple has gained an advantage in processing power, I feel they've lost a fair amount of clout in controlling some aspects of computer design. A lot of work went into the holistic design of the G5 Powermacs, but I somehow wonder if Intel would want to do the same for Apple (holistic design isn't really part of the PC market's style). Apple is no longer a big fish in a small pond (like it was with the PowerPC), but is instead a smaller fish in a big pond. If Intel ever has to choose between making Apple happy or Dell happy, I think the lovefest will be over.</li>
<li>Intel has had a terrible track record in delivering 64-bit chips (unlike competitor AMD). I wonder how this move is going to affect people who needed the 64-bit capabilities of the G5.</li>
<li>This move also marks the continuing ascendency of the appliance part of Apple over the computer business. I think Steve Jobs is just tired of the chip design part of the business and would rather farm that aspect off to someone else (even though it means some loss of control). More importantly, unlike IBM, Intel makes more than one class of chip and I imagine the real ramifications of this move will not be high-end Pentiums in computers but lower end chips in tablets, cheaper Macs and a proliferation of appliances.</li>
<li>So, how exactly are they planning to sell any computers in the next year? Better hope iPod sales stay strong.</li>
<li>I hope I never have to see one of those Intel Inside stickers on my Mac. Those things are ugly.</li>
</ul>

Well, these certainly are interesting times. For further reading on the subject and speculation, I recommend one of the following links:
<ul>
<li>O'Reilly interviewed <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7201">some big Mac developers on the switch.</a> Overall views are actually positive.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,67767,00.html?tw=rss.TOP">Wired News also talked to developers</a> and also found most were surprised but mollified by the ease of transition.</li>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Intellectual Property Law is not really an area I'm expecting to write about often in this blog. Besides the fact that other people do it much better than me (see <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a> or <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/">Declan McCullough's Politech</a> for instance), and I must admit that I hew largely to the standard technocratic view on copyright, mainly that I am not opposed to it in principle (I'm happy to buy my music and movies), but I also think the current extensions to the duration of copyright is insane and too much power is being given to large corporations at the expense of future creativity and fair use. Nothing you won't find elsewhere, so I don't think this is an area I need to add my scintillating insight to that often.

That said, I do find this story (and attached discussion) at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a> titled <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/06/16/copyright_cops_crack.html">"Copyright cops crack down on cooks over cakes"</a> fascinating because it shows just how strange copyright has become and it's quite local to me too. The College Bakery is a nice little place in my neighborhood of Carroll Gardens where you can get lots of nice old-fashioned and wholesome pastry, cakes, pies, etc. To cut a long story short, <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a> noticed the last time he was in there that they had posted the sign above. As he puts it:
<blockquote>Now the decor and ambience of College Bakery are echt Old Brooklyn, so it's an unlikely front in the copyfight, but the staff said they had to bust out the magic markers because they'd been roped in as the front line of defense against non-licit images of Dora the ExplorerÂ® and Thomas the Tank EngineÂ®. </blockquote>
Yes, it's come to this. The large fortunes of Nickelodeon or other copyright holders are so threatened by the few custom cakes that the College Bakery makes a week that they had to take action. And certainly, I suppose there are other large bakeries that have paid licensing fees that are nominally harmed by the "infringing activity" here. But, honestly who cares? Are the property rights of copyright so paramount and absolute that it's worth denying some six year old who loves Dora (and probably has bought a fair share of Dora merchandise) one lousy cake? Do the copyright holders need to defend everything with an iron fist? More importantly, are we ceding ownership of our culture and our creativity to large corporations?]]></content:encoded>

  <title>RSS as an Error Reporting Mechanism</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An <em>interesting</em> idea occurred to me the other day...

</p><p>First, a disclaimer. This is not a specification. Specifications are fixed and obsessively spelled out, and I would rather explore the idea fully first. Besides, specifications are notoriously boring and opaque, and I think that's part of the problem I want to address. So, let's get started.</p>

<h2>The Wonders of RSS</h2>

<p>RSS is a pretty neat thing when you think about it. In the past 3 years we have seen a veritable explosion of sites that create RSS feeds and interesting readers that consume them. It's led to some pretty sophisticated ways of reading the web, and your standard aggregator allows grouping, regular checking, unicode support and searching. In addition, newer apps even allow users to do things like create "virtual feeds" by specifying search queries that can be run across multiple feeds, while services like Bloglines allow you to take your subscriptions anywhere around the globe and will probably soon over ways of transposing RSS items into emails or SMS content or such. I imagine the next big thing will be helping us to better cope with information overload from RSS feeds. Which is fascinating stuff. Especially fascinating is that this is in spite of (<em>or rather because of</em>) RSS is painfully stupid. It's not the first or the "best" mechanism for distributing content across the Internet (I think many would argue that NNTP is far more elegant and scalable), but its basic simplicity and ease of manipulation has made it a winner (although IMHO it took the further simplification of RSS2.0 and Atom vs. RSS1.0 to ensure this.)</p>

<p>So, what was my point in a nutshell? There are several awesome things about RSS that I think should be noted in a bullet list:</p>

<ol>
<li>Very simple. The RSS2.0 spec is so basic that deserves the name <strong>Really Simple Syndication</strong></li>
<li>Doesn't care about transport. If HTTP is good enough for everybody else, it's good enough for us. Of course, you could put RSS on top of other things, but the important thing is that we don't need to worry about implementing the transport layer here.</li>
<li>Extensible. One good thing about RSS is that you can embed additional content in the basic RSS feed. As long as you use a namespace for your elements, any good RSS reader <em>should</em> ignore them, but savvy ones can use them.</li>
<li>Regular checks. One of the common complaints about RSS is that it's a dumb pull-based mechanism and thus can cause many redundant server accesses from every RSS client checking a feed once an hour. This however is a virtue in my mind. It keeps things simple (<em>no subscription tracking</em>).</li>
<li>Time management. With RSS you're not so much browsing the web; instead you are <strong>monitoring</strong> it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Read that last point again. Because this is where I went from Modern Web 101 to a Reese's peanut butter cup moment (<em>I'll explain the product plug in a bit</em>). When you get down to it, there is nothing in RSS2.0 (<em>or RSS1.0 or Atom; I <strong>don't care</strong> which RSS spec you prefer</em>) that says the items in an RSS channel have to be documents somewhere (ie, new stories, new photos, etc.). And in fact, I would argue that the meaning of an RSS item is really as an <strong>event</strong> which just happens to be tied to a particular story in many cases. <em>But it doesn't have to be</em>.</p>

<h2>RSS and Error Reporting</h2>

<p>Okay, the title here gives away where I'm going with this, but I still want to provide a little more background on things. In my office, I'm a backend guy. This means I do a lot of work tying together various systems and making sure data flows around smoothly and efficiently. It works really well actually and I'm quite proud of our simple system (more on that later). But errors are inevitable, and they occur in many different areas. Imagine you have a web server farm with applications. You can think of where errors occur in terms of domains (listed below with some standard error reporting mechanisms)</p>

<ol>
<li>Hardware - if the underlying machine has problems, the OS will hopefully catch it. If you're using Unix-based systems, you can configure <code>syslog</code>*. Otherwise, on a Windows-machine it might get logged into the System Events and perhaps picked up by a third-party tool like <code>Patrol</code> or such.</li>
<li>Network - Routers, firewalls, etc. can go down. <code>SNMP</code> seems to be the standard mechanism for reporting problems in the network. </li>
<li>Availabilty - A machine may be up but unreachable due to high load or other things. <code>NAGIOS</code> is a way of catching this.</li>
<li>Web Server - the web server may have problems with some requests. This are generally logged to a local HTTP log. Logs from multiple HTTP servers can be sent to another host via <code>syslog</code>, but this is rarely done.</li>
<li>Web Application errors - in the best cases these might be logged to a local file on the server, but usually they are just displayed on the screen to the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a few interesting things to note here: </p>

<ol>
<li>Some of these error reporting solutions also include a networking protocol in addition to an error format, meaning you could assemble a centralized console for error reporting; no such luck in the web server.</li>
<li>For applications, it's pretty much left to each developer. As a result, errors if they are logged are often local, since not many people think to use <code>syslog</code> for error reporting. </li>
<li>I think the ideal thing for site maintenance is to have some sort of centralized view of errors in the system as they occur.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyhow, to cut an already long story somewhat short, I was working on an application that would automatically generate and process RSS feeds that I wanted to be robust and I wanted to know whenever errors occurred without having to login to the machine (ala <code>syslog</code>). So, I looked into some ways of reporting/logging errors when it struck me: <strong>why not use RSS as an error reporting mechanism</strong>? </p>

<h2>You Got Your RSS in My Syslog, You Got Your Syslog in My RSS!</h2>

<p>And so we get to my Reese's Peanut Butter Cup reference. Think about it, RSS has some real advantages to error reporting:</p>

<ol>
<li>Very simple. RSS has a lot of support across many platforms and with a wide range of viewers/aggregators. Does syslog or other networked error reporting mechanism. And it has support in programming language libraries too.</li>
<li>Doesn't care about transport. HTTP is established and allowed through most corporate firewalls. No dumb network debugging or NAT fiddling and such.</li>
<li>Extensible. One size doesn't fit all. I might want to record basic messages in some cases (ie, "printer on fire") or capture detailed stack traces in another (Rails logging). XML + Namespaces is a great way of layering stuff in there (<em>although you need an RSS reader that will allow you to look at the underlying XML to get the extra data</em>)</li>
<li>Regular Checks. I like the pull communication of RSS because it acts like a heartbeat to your error reporting services; when something is wrong with one of my sources, I <em>know</em> it because my RSS reader tells me so. (<em>to make an analogy, suppose you had a phone to be called for emergencies; does not getting any calls mean that there are no emergencies or might the line be dead?</em>). Granted, I might not get an error <em>immediately</em>, but to be honest I don't think I've encountered many errors that a 5 minute delay would've made impossible to handle; don't use it your nuclear reactor though I guess.</li>
<li>Time Management. So, if I wanted to I could have errors, warning, statistics and other things coming into my central console. I don't have an insight into the best way to manage all this information effectively, but I have a pretty good idea that problems of information overload will be tackled much sooner in the RSS world than they have been in the Syslog user base.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, here's the idea. Define a basic set of RSS error fields in a particular XML namespace (like <em>http://www.nimblecode.com/rsserror</em>). This will have a set of optional tags that could be added to items. If users want to define their own extra tags they could just by declaring a new NS like (like <em>http://www.nimblecode.com/rsserror/syslog</em>) and add them. Really, you can add anything to XML, but the NS tags help consumers of the information to know what to expect (so, if I want to look for syslog-type errors). An example of this might be produced soon.</p>

<h2>The Minimum Error Fields</h2>

<p>So, if we were to make a minimal RSS error specification, what optional and required tags would it include. I have an idea:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>&lt;error:msg&gt;</code> The text of an error message. Note that this could also be put in the <code>title</code> or <code>description</code> of the regular RSS <code>item</code>, but I think it's good to define an explicit place in a namespace it will always be.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's it. Obviously, there are other things we might want to record. For instance in my case, I think of optional tags like <code>timestamp</code>, <code>extended</code>, <code>code</code>, <code>hostIp</code>, <code>application</code>, etc. Not to mention some of the error information available with syslog traces, but I want to weigh what tags should go in a given namespace before I start adding options willy-nilly (indeed, there's no reason why you couldn't define your own extensions.) </p>

<p>So for instance, if we were defining an addition <code>syslog</code> RSS error namespace, we could also add the following <code>syslog</code> fields as tags:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>timestamp</code> - a timestamp for the error</li>
<li><code>priority</code> - the priority of the message (EMERG, ERR, WARNING, INFO, etc.)</li>
<li><code>facility</code> - the facility option for syslog (AUTH, MAIL, USER, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, if I were working on extensions for Ruby on Rail's logging format, I could include the following tags:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>timestamp</code> - the time the error occurred.     </li>
<li><code>severity</code> - the severity of the error</li>
<li><code>sql</code> - the SQL executed against the backend server</li>
<li><code>backtrace</code> - the call stack where the error occurred</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these would still use <code>error:msg</code> for the main message with the error. It looks like I should also make <code>timestamp</code> part of the standard set.</p>

So there you have it. I will probably be working on this a bit more, but it's an interesting idea and I'm curious what other people might think.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a monitoring system (kind of like a cross between nagios and big brother, but in Java instead of shell / C / php), and it&#8217;s clear that an <span class="caps">RSS</span> event feed is crucial. However, with the wide variety of data that comes out of any significant datacenter, I was leaning towards a more <span class="caps">RES</span>Tful / del.icio.us / tag driven approach, so each monitoring point would have it&#8217;s own virtual <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed- otherwise, you can get easily swamped with information.</p>


	<p>The real key to a monitoring system is event correlation- discrete events scattered over your aggregator may not be terribly useful, so maybe a recursive / list system (like the new MS proposal) might be a way of bundling up your dependencies all at once.</p>


	<p>I bet you could write a simple Log4J appender that fed an rss server this information as well (if it wasn&#8217;t an <span class="caps">RSS</span> server itself).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;d be surprised if the next version of Nagios didn&#8217;t have an rss feed embedded, though- if they ever get to 2.0 :)</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I too am curious about Information Overload. I think though the key here might be to establish some sort of virtual feed capability in your <span class="caps">RSS</span> aggregator (ie, show me all things tagged with severity=urgent), but I wonder how well that might be. I think the other issue might be security, but salting the <span class="caps">URL</span> for the feed and also limiting to subnets via a configuration file might help there.</p>


	<p>I think you are spot on with the Log4j suggestion and I&#8217;m about to turn my attention to that to see how nice it might be to implement. The only real problem I have with Log4j and syslog is that I would want to break up the message into parts (like backtrace, etc.) before it gets placed into the logger because then it&#8217;s just one long string. But I suppose as a proof of concept, it&#8217;s a start.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to note that I have moved this blog to <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/">Typo</a>, an excellent blogging system written in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> . If you&#8217;re not reading this in an <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader, the change should be pretty apparent, although I must apologize for not having rethemed yet. Otherwise, I look forward to hopefully spending more time blogging and less time doing maintenance in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Rails and the Distribution Question</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> a lot. It&#8217;s a pretty awesome web development frameworrk and it&#8217;s generated a serious amount of buzz for its young age (just over a year). One major milestone that&#8217;s ahead for the language will be a 1.0 release that among other things promises to deliver more <span class="caps">API</span> stability than there has been with more recent releases (as well as freeing developers and writers from creating code that&#8217;s partially outmoded on arrival). Will that mean though that the big development work for Rails will be done? Hardly. If Rails is really to succeed as a development platform, I believe it can only happen if the distribution problems are solved. And Rails 1.0 seems to be a necessary precursor to that.</p>


	<p>I like to think with web application frameworks there are 3 Ds that are important for the platform to succeed:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Development</strong> &#8211; how easy is it to develop?</li>
		<li><strong>Deployment</strong> &#8211; how easy is it to place on your own servers and systems?</li>
		<li><strong>Distribution</strong> &#8211; how easy is it for third-party users to deploy on their servers?</li>
	</ul>


	<p>I think Rails has done very well in the first case. In the second case, I think tools like <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/SwitchTower">Switch Tower</a> will help to make the second problem as nice as the first. But I think the third problem is the most problematic in Rails right now. Essentially, there are no nice and standard ways for developers to package up their Rails-developed programs for other users to easily install (without Rails experience).</p>


	<p>Let me give a concrete example here. As you may know, I recently switched this blog from <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> (a <span class="caps">PHP</span>-based service) to <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">Typo</a> (a Rails-based service). I currently am hosting on Textdrive, which is rare among hosting providers in that it supports the latest Rails versions, so at least I did not have to fight with my <span class="caps">ISP</span> to get Rails as an option. But even then, I must admit that Wordpress&#8217; setup was a dream to use, and not knowing a lick of <span class="caps">PHP</span>, I was able to get a blog up, installed, and running in no time. In contrast, I do have some knowledge of Rails, but Typo was definitely harder. For starters, I had to manually create tables in a MySQL database by running a MySQL file to create the tables (good thing I didn&#8217;t use one of the more obscure adapters like <span class="caps">MS SQL</span> that didn&#8217;t have a manually written schema file for them). I had to go an edit the database.yml config file manually in a shell (not confugured via an install script) Importing the data from Wordpress was a bit difficult too, and I had to fix the import script. Finally, I discovered that I have actually been dispatching Rails methods with the FastCGI dispatcher, even though I&#8217;m not using it currently. So, my blog went down over the weekend and I didn&#8217;t know. Not good.</p>


	<p>This is not to trash Typo, which is a truly excellent product. Nor is it to condemn Rails, which is still too young to even explore a thorough solution to the distribution problem yet. But I think if we start thinking about the future of Rails, the distribution problem is important, because without easy distribution, Rails will be doomed by the network effect. What do I mean by that?</p>


	<p>There are a lot of <span class="caps">PHP</span> developers out there these days, far more than develop for Rails, Django, Seaside or some of the other frameworks out there. Why? Is <span class="caps">PHP</span> a better framework? Arguably no. But is <span class="caps">PHP</span> in a whole lot of publicly deployed web products, like Wordpress? Or more wikis than you can shake a stick at? Yes. This in turn leads to more people thinking of developing in that language, books being written, etc. which accelerates adoption of <span class="caps">PHP</span> even further. The network effect.</p>


	<p>I think 37 Signals, Robot Coop and such have done a lot to advance Rails over the last few years. But ultimately, I think it&#8217;ll do more to sell their particular style of visual design than Rails as a development platform. Sure, there are people making custom solutions from scratch that might be wowed by the backend magic that makes it all happen. But I think there&#8217;s a bigger pool of programmers who might find themselves having to setup a quick Wiki for their intranet or such? Given the choice, how many of them will write a system from scratch in Rails? And how many of them will just grab an existing <span class="caps">PHP</span>-based solution? And once they&#8217;ve done the latter, how likely is it they&#8217;ll look at Rails ever again? The best way for Rails to grow is for there to be many Rails apps to choose from. And to get there, Rails needs to make distribution as easy as development.</p>


	<p>(<em>I hope to follow up on this in a few days with some further observations and ideas.</em>)</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s an interesting time for web development. Not only is <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> steaming along towards version 1.0, but it&#8217;s spurring the development of other web frameworks in the <span class="caps">MVC</span> mold.</p>


	<p>As a case in point, consider <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, a new web framework written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Now, I have been dabbling in Ruby on Rails, but I don&#8217;t really have the time to learn Python yet sadly, and I can&#8217;t really figure out which would be better to do a site from scratch in. What is a developer to do?</p>


	<p>Thankfully, fellow blogger <a href="http://www.jvoorhis.com/">Jeremy Voorhis</a> has stepped into the gap. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, be sure to check out his entries on <a href="http://www.jvoorhis.com/articles/category/django">working with Django</a> on his blog.</p>


	<p>Incidentally, there does not seem to be much ire or competition against relative newcomer Django by the Rails people. In truth, there never should be. It&#8217;s a big enough web for both, and I think there are some things that each framework can learn from each other (Django could benefit from something like ActiveRecord, Rails would be improved if it had Django&#8217;s mechanism for specifying database schema). Such situations are rare in the computing world (see the eternal flames of emacs vs. vi, windows vs. mac, compiled vs. scripting, typed languages vs. dynamic typing, etc.), which makes such cooperation all the more remarkable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Web2.0 Gets Pragmatic</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2005/09/20/web2-0-gets-pragmatic/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen it already, <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">Anil Dash&#8217;s</a> blog article titled <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/09/06/web_development">Web Development Trends for 2006</a> is a worthwhile read for those curious about the future of web technology in the next year.</p>


	<p>For me, the overall theme of this list is &#8220;Web2.0 Grows Up&#8221;. For starters, I would agree that what he terms <strong>dampening</strong> and <strong>buffering</strong> are really the main ways in which <span class="caps">AJAX</span> use will mature from just a &#8220;gee-whiz&#8221; factor to a basic usability requirement. I think this will be helped along by sites standardizing basic interface designs and Ajax libraries like <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a> easing the way for new users. This might also be what pushes more people to do <span class="caps">XHTML</span>/CSS, not because of Greasemonkey, but because it&#8217;s the only way to get your <span class="caps">AJAX</span> stuff to work reliably.</p>


	<p>I think the <span class="caps">ATOM API</span> might be important as well, but I think the bigger trend for 2006 will be the widespread adoption of syndication support (be it <span class="caps">RSS2</span>.0 or Atom) in many more places. <span class="caps">RSS</span> shines right not as a lightweight information sharing mechanism that puts <span class="caps">REST</span> to shame, not to mention the huge mess that is <span class="caps">SOAP</span>. It&#8217;s small wonder that even Microsoft has adopted <span class="caps">RSS</span> support within Windows Vista. While I suppose the Atom <span class="caps">API</span> will create a new buzz, I think the bigger excitement will be web developers placing <span class="caps">RSS</span> in places there are none and finding new creative ways to use <span class="caps">RSS</span> that haven&#8217;t been dreamed of yet.</p>


	<p>One area that Anil Dash highlights that I would like to see come to fruition though is <strong>geeks marketing themselves</strong>. On this, he is completely correct on the importance of this, but I haven&#8217;t seen much evidence of this in the past. However, I think it might change soon. For starters, more developers and geeks are actively getting their presence out there, mainly by showing that blogging is not just for livejournal teens talking about their daily emotions. The profusion of several active Wikis is also a promising sign. Finally, I have to hope that Chad Fowler&#8217;s forthcoming book <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">My Job Went to India</a> (which I had the honor of test reading) will be enough to convince the remaining stragglers of the importance of promoting themselves for their careers.</p>


	<p>I believe it&#8217;s as essential as learning to code these days. Which is why I&#8217;ve started blogging in the first place. But  I will write more on that later&#8230;</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have guessed from this site, I am hardly a person you would expect to praise Microsoft for their technical insight and forward thinking. Like the story about generals, they always seem to be fighting the last war, with their late arrival to the Internet and Web being a current and recurring example (now, rather than Netscape, it&#8217;s Google that is seen as their greatest threat). However, occasionally they get a thing right along the way, and I feel honor-bound to note it in this case.</p>


	<p>Over at <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a>, there is an article <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/22/rss_business_apps/">RSS Goes To Work In Windows</a> detailing the ways in which Microsoft has jumped onto the <span class="caps">RSS</span> bandwagon with Windows Vista (shipping next year, maybe?). For those of you following along at home, Microsoft is planning to ship a built in <span class="caps">RSS</span>-store capability in Windows which will allow any application compiled against the appropriate <span class="caps">API</span> to be an <span class="caps">RSS</span> aggregator and manipulate feeds programmatically. This is a nice touch, but hardly a stretch yet.</p>


	<p>What is interesting to me is that Microsoft discusses their plans to have the next release of their Dynamics <acronym title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</acronym> software to create <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds that can be syndicated to. Other server applications with <span class="caps">RSS</span> extensions in the works are Sharepoint Portal, Exchange, and possible Office. As the article quotes it</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;CRM is one of the first examples of how we see <span class="caps">RSS</span> unlocking data in the back end data systems,&#8221; Amar Gandhi, Microsoft Internet Explorer group program manager, told The Register during a recent interview. Microsoft revealed plans to <span class="caps">RSS</span>-enable its <span class="caps">CRM</span> last week at the Professional Developers&#8217; Conference (PDC)</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Chris Caposella, vice president for Microsoft&#8217;s information worker product management group, told software developers attending <span class="caps">PDC </span>Microsoft believes <span class="caps">RSS</span> would be transformed into a platform that embraces business applications.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>That last paragraph was something I&#8217;d never see. Because honestly, I never thought people would &#8220;accept&#8221; <span class="caps">RSS</span> in the Enterprise. While we can joke about how <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/define_enterprise_in_10_words_or_less.php">meaningless the term Enterprise Software is</a>, <span class="caps">RSS</span> is definitely not it by any usual sense of the term for several reasons:</p>


	<ol>
	<li><span class="caps">RSS</span> in general has no typing or generalized schema. It&#8217;s really a schema for news stories that can be generalized for events, but it&#8217;s not for serialization of complex typed objects like <span class="caps">SOAP</span>.</li>
		<li>The <span class="caps">RSS</span> model is extremely simple. Pull requests over <span class="caps">HTTP</span>. No pushing, no notification mechanism for new content.</li>
		<li>In itself, <span class="caps">RSS</span> has no security for content (I know, Atom has support for encrypted content), and access security is generally only done through obscurity (giving an individual user a feed with a long unique token in it, maybe unguessable, but not unsniffable)</li>
		<li>Finally, <span class="caps">RSS</span> is not really controlled. There are no authorization lists, no ACLs or <span class="caps">DRM</span> or other such mechanisms to control who can subscribe and where they can do it.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>That said, I think all of these aspects are why <span class="caps">RSS</span> has succeeded so widely in the world of the Web2.0, <a href="/articles/2005/04/16/radical-simplification">while <span class="caps">SOAP</span> has largely failed to gain traction</a>. In fact, considering that one of <span class="caps">SOAP</span>&#8217;s biggest backers is Microsoft, this <span class="caps">RSS</span> announcement reveals what a disappointment <span class="caps">SOAP</span> has been as a web service platform. So, why is a company like Microsoft so willing to reject one of its software initiatives and embrace <span class="caps">RSS</span> so, in effect giving <span class="caps">RSS</span> an mantle of legitimacy in the Enterprise it might&#8217;ve taken years to achieve?</p>


	<p>I think that if we want to consider the <a href="/articles/2005/09/20/web2-0-gets-pragmatic">biggest Web2.0 trend for the coming year</a>, it won&#8217;t be the proliferation of <span class="caps">AJAX</span> or increasing maturity of Web Frameworks. It&#8217;ll be the proliferation of <span class="caps">RSS</span> into every aspect of server-side content. One of the greatest things about <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a> is that you can subscribe to an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed for every possible page. And since pages are dynamic content (combinations of photos, groups, tags, users), what you are really subscribing to is not a list of documents, but <strong>the latest matches for a search</strong> (ie, &#8220;find me all photos tagged Italy by this user&#8221;). And it&#8217;s easy to do, regardless of the site.</p>


	<p>One of the cool features of Mac <span class="caps">OSX </span>Tiger&#8217;s Spotlight (and probably Windows Vista) is the ability to save searches as virtual folders which can be opened and browsed like regular folders in the Finder. This is a really cool way to manage ever-growing content. Now, imagine being able to do similar functionality with server-side content, and suddenly the appeal of <span class="caps">RSS</span> makes a lot of sense (admittedly since <span class="caps">RSS</span> usually shows only the last 20 items or so, there is a <em>you snooze, you lose</em> problem, the general metaphor holds). Most of the Web2.0 is about taking the applications of the desktop into the browser, this brings the web back into the machine and applications.</p>


	<p>No wonder Microsoft suddenly has the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/">RSS Religion</a>. Done well, this might be their best chance to keep people hooked into Windows <strong>and</strong> all their software products for business. Of course, they are trying to do the old <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/06/24/ms-rss/">embrace, extend, extinguish trick</a>, but this time it may not fly because Microsoft&#8217;s not in the driver&#8217;s seat for the technology. That said, I must admit that Microsoft has made a smart and proactive move for the future here, and I think it&#8217;ll benefit them well. But more importantly, it lends a large amount of authority to <span class="caps">RSS</span> in the Enterprise, which makes <span class="caps">RSS</span> and the Open Source Standards-Based community the biggest winner of all. At Alacra, we&#8217;ve felt that <a href="http://www.alacrablog.com/alacrablog/2005/07/rss_is_new_medi.html">RSS will be much bigger in the Enterprise</a> for a while. It&#8217;s neat to see we&#8217;re not alone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Great Picture, But One Quibble</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;padding-right:.5em;" class="flickrplugin"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36521959321@N01/44349798"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/28/44349798_0e487287bc_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Web2MemeMap"></a></div> Courtesy of Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/foocamp05/index.cgi">Foo Camp</a> (which I am definitely not cool enough to be invited to), there is now a picture to match the exciting flow of ideas and themes coalescing into <strong>Web 2.0</strong>. I think this assemblage of bubbles and trends is a great thing to see, especially since it serves as a better executive summary of high-level ideas than gleaning bits and pieces of the big picture from blogs and demo sites across the web.

	<p>That said, I think one thing is missing from the picture they provide. Maybe I am a bit <a href="/articles/tag/rss">preoccupied</a> with the subject, but I think <span class="caps">RSS </span>(<em>or Atom here, I&#8217;m just using <span class="caps">RSS</span> as shorthand for syndication</em>) is really one of the biggest things driving Web2.0 services and adoption these days, but it hasn&#8217;t even gotten a mention in the top as an influencing technology (unlike blogs or Gmail). I think blogs were great at establishing <span class="caps">RSS</span> as a way of keeping track of changes, but the really influential aspect of Del.icio.us and Flickr is not just tagging, but establishing <span class="caps">RSS</span> as a <a href="/articles/2005/09/23/rss-comes-to-the-enterprise">mechanism for tracking any possible view of the system you might want</a> in as light-weight and user-friendly mechanism as possible (as opposed to the awkwardness of <span class="caps">SOAP</span> or even <span class="caps">REST</span> to the end user).</p>


	<p>I think the source of my unease here is that I&#8217;m mostly a backend guy. A lot of my work at Alacra has been making sure that all sorts of information flows agilely between processes and servers. Backend stuff. It makes it happen, but if it&#8217;s working, you never notice how critical it is to success. Similarly, <span class="caps">AJAX</span> and other front-end browser mechanisms are very nice in my mind. But the biggest joys and successes of Web2.0 are all driven by the fluidity and ease of <span class="caps">RSS</span> and <span class="caps">REST</span>. &#8220;Hackability&#8221;, &#8220;Data as Intel Inside&#8221;, &#8220;Right to Remix&#8221; ... <span class="caps">RSS</span> made this a possibility and these are what drives me to take Web2.0 seriously and not just as another wave of web hype. All I&#8217;m asking for is a little recognition. Thanks.</p>


	<p><strong>Update:</strong> The good news is that it seems like I&#8217;m not alone in this view. The bad news is my company is <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/27#web20IsReallySimple">Dave Winer</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My Job Went To India</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2005/09/30/my-job-went-to-india/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pleasant surprise was waiting for me when I got home today. A copy of Chad Fowler&#8217;s excellent book <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">My Job Went To India</a> was waiting for me in the mail. I&#8217;m not sure that I can give an objective review (for reasons I&#8217;ll go into here), but if you are serious about making a career in programming, you should buy this book.</p>


	<p>What Mr. Fowler does here is to take a fair and interesting look at how outsourcing has affected the field of software development. If you want a breathy ode to a flat world where we&#8217;re all information works or a hysterical screed against them foreigners taking jobs, this is not a book for you. But if you&#8217;re a programmer like me who likes to develop, but also wants to know how to control his career, this book has the pragmatic information you need.</p>


	<p>The problem is, most software devlopers really don&#8217;t deserve their jobs more than a given developer in India or somewhere else (don&#8217;t fault them for their zeal and definitely do not underestimate their smarts). We usually fail in several ways:</p>


	<ol>
	<li><strong>Skills.</strong> Have you learned any new technologies in the last year? How much do you control how you design and implement things, or do you just mindlessly code specs given from on high?</li>
		<li><strong>Business.</strong> Any developer can see the technical dimensions of a problem, but very few are able to grasp the business side of their jobs. Do you know your business domain? Do you understand how the bottom line at your company works?</li>
		<li><strong>Communication.</strong> The stereotype of the developer as a lone wolf working strange hours and sitting sullenly in a dark office is often all too true. This needs to change. If the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of your company doesn&#8217;t understand what you do, why exactly would he think it couldn&#8217;t be done better in India?</li>
		<li><strong>Marketing.</strong> There is a world outside of your company. Should you lose your job, what sort of network do you have to draw on? And what exactly would convince an employer to hire you?</li>
		<li><strong>Passion.</strong> Finally, are you sure you even want to be a developer in the first place? Is this a career you fell into, or one you want to fight for?</li>
	</ol>


	<p>As I was noting earlier, <a href="/articles/2005/09/20/web2-0-gets-pragmatic">self promotion</a> is one of biggest failings of geeks these days. I realized this was my biggest problem last year, but I&#8217;m glad to see such an authoritative and well-crafted examination of the problem in Chad&#8217;s book.</p>


	<p>Which brings me to why I must concede I can&#8217;t give an entirely objective review to this book. Around six months ago, I decided to get more involved in the online community. I started blogging, and I started reading blogs of alpha geeks whose judgements I respected. This included people in the Ruby on Rails community, and <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad&#8217;s blog</a> was one of them. A short time later, Chad asked for test readers for his draft manuscript, and I offered to help. He accepted me as a test editor, and i enjoyed the experience immensely. It was a great way to test the strength of his book and correct weaknesses, and I have to commend Chad for it. And I&#8217;m proud I could help out and become more involved with my career in the process. It&#8217;s a good book. Buy it. It&#8217;s worth it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Web2.0 Road to Riches</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2005/10/05/web2-0-road-to-riches/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the day of the first Web boom, it seems like a lot of companies were started on the simple premise of</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Make a web site</li>
		<li><span class="caps">IPO</span> or maybe get bought out</li>
		<li>Cash out with millions!</li>
	</ol>


	<p>And so, a boom and bubble was born. The problem here was a lot of VCs and rational investors found themselves swept up in the frenzy back in the day, and placed their bets even though there was no real knowable way to accurately estimate the future profitability or net worth of their investments. Sure, there was a risk of failure, but that wasn&#8217;t viewed as negatively as the risk of not getting in early while it was still cheap. Add that to the later shared delusion of being able to cash out before the bubble burst, and the shortsightedness of those days is a lot more understandable. It seems though we&#8217;re on the verge of a new way of thinking:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Make a web site</li>
		<li>Get bought out by <strong>Yahoo or Google</strong></li>
		<li>Cash out with millions!</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being a bit pessimistic (and I will freely admit I&#8217;m no business expert), but I am slightly concerned about there being a new web bubble that could lead to disillusionment over Web2.0 technology. I like Google, but I think their stock is too overvalued at over $300 a share; thankfully, the company seems <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB112484195945721307-iI70ia22lcLXd7VmPaKkBZxfIFs_20060824.html?mod=rss_free">interested in correcting</a>
this problem. And Web2.0 has become such a hype word among investors, it&#8217;s led to a wave of people trying to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">define what it is</a>, <a href="http://www.discover.com/issues/oct-05/departments/emerging-technology/">offering alternative definitions</a>, and <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/the_top_10_things_that_arent_web_20.php">mocking the business world for caring</a>
Investors looking for the next big thing are starting to latch onto the Web2.0 excitement and I think some people think Google and Yahoo can do no wrong; I only hope they do their homework first this time.</p>


	<p>On the technical side of things, I have a fear of web developers starting companies with the sole goal of being bought by Google or Yahoo in a few years or less. There&#8217;s a big difference between planning a business for the long haul and hoping to get snatched up before you burn through all your cash in two years. So, I must admit it was with some dismay today that I read that Yahoo has acquired <a href="http://www.upcoming.org/">Upcoming.org</a>, just like it had with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. This is not to begrudge Upcoming their success (it&#8217;s a great web app), but I&#8217;m just afraid of where the combination of lazy web developers and over-eager investors will take us. We&#8217;ve been there before, and I don&#8217;t want to see it again.</p>


	<p>And of course, the biggest problem with all this is the way in which this weaking leads to the end of the openness and choice out there now. How many options are there really if your choice for web applications is between Yahoo and Google? Will this lead to a segmentation of content and communication? And more importantly, if you think that the Web2.0 is all about the free flow and interchange of data, won&#8217;t the growth of Google and Yahoo into all areas of the Internet choke that off?</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>More on the Web2.0 Bubble</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2005/10/07/more-on-the-web2-0-bubble/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems like I&#8217;m not the only person thinking about the Web2.0 hype in terms of the previous bubble. There have been two interesting articles posted on the subject, sparked by massive interest in the Web2.0 conference this year (for me, it&#8217;s an effect of finding an old exuberant <a href="http://www.ancientcomputer.com/museum/images/magazines/base500/wired_6_06.jpg">issue of Wired from 1998</a>).</p>


	<p>First up, there is a post on the subject from <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com">O&#8217;Reilly Radar</a> titled <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/10/if_everyone_thinks_its_a_bubbl.html">If Everyone Thinks It&#8217;s a Bubble, It&#8217;s Not a Bubble</a>. This quite frankly is an idiotic title. I&#8217;m not a VC, but near the end of dot-com boom, even I and everbody knew that things were undervalued and it was a bubble. Still, many people thought they could cash out in time. Anyhow, despite that disappointing start, this article redeems itself with the following insight</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Here at Web 2.0, no one believes the mania, at least not yet. No one thinks, as they did in 1999, that we&#8217;re looking at new technologies that will, say, wipe away bricks and mortar retailers and leave online businesses in their place. No one believes that old and powerful industries are about to be destroyed en masse by the rise of asynchronous Javascript or data as the Intel inside. These Web 2.0 markers are great developments, and are enabling great applications to get attention and immediately dominate the Web applications they replace. They&#8217;ve clearly valuable. As of yet, though, Web 2.0 is a revision of the Web and what has been built on it, not a revision of the world, which was the premise of the last bubble.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Which is very true. As much as we can joke and fret about the Web2.0 hype, it has not been on the level of the hype back in the previous bubble. Where the web was going to annihilate geography, change the way we shop, and connect us all in one happy hive-mind. Expectations <em>are</em> more realistic now on the technical side, but I do wonder if people still believe in Google and Yahoo too much.</p>


	<p>From a different perspective, <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/">Fred Wilson</a> has answered my silent prayers and given me an example of what a <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/10/web_20_reaction.html">VC thinks about Web2.0</a> . Fred&#8217;s a really smart guy (I am only slightly biased because he&#8217;s an investor in Alacra), so I like to think he reflects the thinking among the smart money in the tech sector when he notes:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Last year at this time we were talking about interesting companies like Skype, Flickr, MySpace, etc.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Many of them are gone, gobbled up by the web 1.0 giants or the mainstream media companies.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>In their places we are seeing second derivatives.  I heard one business described as Google Maps meets delicious, and another described as Skype meets MySpace.  When the first derivative hasn&#8217;t fully figured its long term business model (other than getting bought), the second derivates are pretty scary.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I am a contrarian at heart.  This situation bothers me.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Translation: <strong>VCs won&#8217;t just fund your mashup because it&#8217;s cool.</strong> As I was ranting the other day, there has to be more to a business plan than <a href="/articles/2005/10/05/web2-0-road-to-riches">hoping to be be bought by Yahoo or Google</a>, and it&#8217;s even sillier to expect fame and riches from doing a mashup. Thankfully, rational voices are prevailing here, so the innovations of Web2.0 won&#8217;t be lost in the disappointment of a bubble bursting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be a lot of buzz around the concept of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), as long as you don&#8217;t ask any of its proponents what it actually means. For an example of the ways in which English can be mangled by technical jargon beyond recognition, check out some of the definitions from <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1017004,00.html">A Defining Moment for <span class="caps">SOA</span></a> and <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1044083,00.html">Revisiting the Definitive <span class="caps">SOA </span>Definition</a> to see what I mean. My personal favorite from the bunch is</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>SOA is a form of technology architecture that adheres to the principles of service orientation. When realized through the Web services technology platform, <span class="caps">SOA</span> establishes the potential to support and promote these principles throughout the business process and automation domains of an enterprise.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>which really tells me nothing at all about why this is cool and where you would start if your <span class="caps">CEO</span> suddenly decided you needed it. Cutting through the bombast and hype, it seems like <span class="caps">SOA</span> is basically</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Wrapping a backend database or similar resource in a small component for business logic you can talk to with <span class="caps">XML</span>.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>This is definitely cool for many reasons (loose coupling, security, building big things from small parts), but I don&#8217;t understand why there&#8217;s so much hype about it now. Not to boast, but we&#8217;ve been doing this at <a href="http://www.alacra.com">Alacra</a> for <strong>8 years</strong> now, and I&#8217;m really gobsmacked that this sort of architecture would be a revelation to anyone, especially since it builds on design patterns good sense and the older Unix and later Internet philosophy that <a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/">Small Pieces Loosely Joined</a> can make great things. And <span class="caps">SOA</span> is pretty much what the earliest <span class="caps">XML</span>-driven web services were.</p>


	<p>I can only assume that the latest hype about <span class="caps">SOA</span> is less about what the technology is, but what it is not. Hint: add a P and you can see what businesses find so refreshing about <span class="caps">SOA</span>. SOAP is a heavyweight protocol that can be good for some external APIs, but is a lot more work than a simple quick and dirty internal application often needs. Imagine being able to drop the requirements of <span class="caps">WSDL</span> bindings, <span class="caps">XML</span> typing, even limited data structures to get the most lightweight, low-ceremony solutions you can feel comfortable with using. And since it&#8217;s internal, you don&#8217;t have to worry about the &#8220;shame&#8221; of not being fully <span class="caps">SOAP</span>+WS-whatever compliant for your <span class="caps">API</span>. Looking at it this way, no wonder they&#8217;re excited. I&#8217;d be excited too if I were able to stop documenting and start hacking for change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Amazon Shakes Things Up</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2005/12/14/amazon-shakes-things-up/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really must hand it to Amazon/A9/Alexa. They have consistently delivered more innovation to the developer than those two combined. Amazon started to impress me when they allowed any application to search their extensive database of product information. Directly they have earned nothing from this, but it more than makes up for itself in good will and inspired purchases. Amazon understands Web Services.</p>


	<p>Amazon also has a search engine. But here they are not the market leader like they are for books. Poor A9, always ignored while Google and Yahoo and <span class="caps">MSN</span> get copious amounts of press and praise.  But this has been good to spur on Amazon and Alexa (their search company) into creative new territory for their search engine. A9 has already received some attention for their YellowPages data that includes photos of storefronts; that&#8217;s certainly cool, but it&#8217;s just content. On the other hand, OpenSearch is a cool change to the spider-driven notion of search content. Google may have specified their <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/login">sitemap standard</a> for giving hints to spiders. But A9 did that one better with their <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">OpenSearch <span class="caps">RSS</span> extensions</a>, which allowed any site to package itself as a channel for A9.com. This allows sites to handle search requests dynamically at the time of request, rather than creating documents to then be spidered and cached.</p>


	<p>To illustrate why this is a cool idea, suppose I had a site that did hotel bookings. I could create an A9 channel that could accomodate search requests for things like &#8220;nyc hotels&#8221; with actual  hotels and rates from that moment. If people had date information, I could be more clever, but the key of this is that Amazon is handing over control of their search results to the end sites. As long as a user is willing to trust a channel enough to add it, A9 is happy to get out of the way.</p>


	<p>Of course, there is nothing to make syndicated OpenSearch sites obey search rules in the same way A9 does, but who cares? As Google&#8217;s success with a single bar shows, people care less about all the little details of searching (boolean vs. web syntax, stemming, relevance scoring) than just being able to find stuff. Amazon gets this, but Google seems to have forgotten it.</p>


	<p>But Amazon/A9/Alexa&#8217;s latest move has really blown me away. In recent years, a lot of search providers have found additional revenue in peddling search appliances to companies. Essentially, you sign a contract with a company Google and buy a local web spider that crawls content you specify. You then pay  Google a price based on support, how many documents you plan to index, and how many users will search your index. There are limitations to keep you from turning Google against themselves and all pricing is set up front rather than growing with use, and prices can approach up to $2 million up front. More importantly, you are not actually using Google&#8217;s index, just recreating part of it independently. And while Google has much vaunted data centers across the globe, enterprise customers get only a single box or two to place in their own data centers if they have them.</p>


	<p>Amazon has been interested in entering the enterprise market, but they did not want to be in the business of creating hardware servers for enterprise clients (Google will always be better at that). And that&#8217;s when someone at Alexa had the brilliant idea of opening up <a href="http://websearch.alexa.com/">their entire search index data to the outside world</a>. And what makes it additionally brilliant is that you install nothing locally (everything is done via Web Services) and pricing is set by consumption and not by contract, meaning even the most modest users can do something with the backend data. Users can write programs to process data sets, implement their own additional indices on top of A9&#8217;s basic web search, or even just analyze a massive collection of web pages for statistical goals. In some sense, Amazone allows customers to not just outsource spidering but also maintenance of indices they&#8217;ve built.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a brilliant move, and I must applaud Amazon for the creativity of their vision. Forget Google and Yahoo, Amazon is doing more to turn Search into a utility than the any other company around.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Calculate Your NYTYIIH Score!</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past 5 years, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> has graced with an annual roundup article titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2005/12/11/magazine/index.html">The Year In Ideas</a>. The issue actually came out last week, but it&#8217;s a sign of my recent workload &#8211; and the excessive number of holiday parties I had to attend &#8211; that I only read it on the commute into work today.</p>


	<p>It actually was rather boring. Not because of the ideas themselves, but because I had actually read many of them before on various blogs and other geeky websites (<em>Sometimes, I long for a service like &#8220;del.icio.us&#8221; for feed subscriptions just so I can share how hip the feeds I read are)</em>. I am not an information omnivore by any means, but it was apparent that I was cued into some of the same idea sources as the editors of the New York Times. Which led to an idea of my own. Since the New York Times has declared its Year In Ideas issue to be an annual tradition, I&#8217;m going to start my own personal tradition of tabulating my personal New York Times Year In Ideas Hipness score (or <span class="caps">NYTYIIH</span> for short). The methodology is simple. Look at every idea listed and if you had heard of it before reading in the Times, give yourself a point. Okay, let&#8217;s get started then.</p>


	<p>The following table lists the titles of the ideas in the 2005 Year in Ideas issue with bold ones being ideas I had encountered before. I know some of the titles are cryptic, but you can take that up with the New York Times editors and not me.</p>

  <title>Yahoo and Google's Recruitment Gambles</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a> had a really interesting point earlier this month about Yahoo&#8217;s <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> purchase that I just read today (been catching up), when <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/05/12/10007.html">he says</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>There&#8217;s an interesting story in here somewhere about how Yahoo! is hiring/buying the &#8220;alpha geeks&#8221; (hackers, tinkerers, accidental entrepreneurs) and Google seemingly isn&#8217;t (Ph.Ds, computer scientists) and what effect that could have on each company&#8217;s development.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Spot on. It seems like Google has been focusing its efforts lately mainly on acquiring key smart people (even if that means buying their whole company), content acquisition (ie, Keyhole for satellite data, the sitemap protocol for deep web access), and advertising/advertising/advertising! Meanwhile, Yahoo has been looking for new talent with proven success to snap up. Their strategy could really be defined as <em>platforms</em>. Amazon has also been doing this to some degree through their internal <a href="http://www.robotcoop.com/">Robot Coop</a> front company, but I expect they might start buying outside sites as well if they prove successful (good luck there <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing!</a>). It&#8217;s nice for the big guys; someone else takes the risk of building the product and they can scoop it up &#8211; users and all &#8211; if it sticks.</p>


	<p>This has been described as competing strategies of brains vs. hackers. Which is certainly true, but there are some interesting other dimensions to consider. I read an interview with Eric Schmidt of Google where he named <a href="http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#nih">the not invented here</a>  attitude as one of Google&#8217;s biggest concerns moving forward. And looking at their strategy, it seems like Google might be struggling with that problem now, preferring to create their own copies of existing successful products (Googlemaps and Gmail have done well, but what about Google Base or Orkut?). Of course, Yahoo is taking its own risks here (their strategy is essentially treating geeks like value stocks vs. Google&#8217;s growth stocks), but I ultimately feel they might succeed. A lot of radical web stuff lately has been done by the new people, the unknows (think <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> or <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a>), and Yahoo has been more poised to recognize it. Will their riskier unknowns best Google&#8217;s smart people with big reputations? I think so, unless Google&#8217;s hiding something really big up its sleeves to spring in 2006.</p>


	<p>On a related note, John Battelle has published his <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002149.php">industry predictions for 2006</a> and it&#8217;s an interesting read. Although he sometimes stumbles, he generally does a good job of being on the mark, as his review of <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002139.php">2005&#8217;s predictions shows</a>. Check it out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been an excellent week for my geeky self-esteem, with beta invitations to both <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/">Ma.gnolia</a> (a new bookmarking site) and <a href="http://www.measuremap.com/">Measuremap</a> (a blog statistics tracking program). Both are written in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> and both look pretty awesome. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say (not sure how much I can legally say yet), but I will close with the observation that there&#8217;s an energy for new projects on the web I haven&#8217;t seen in years and that the <a href="http://caboo.se/">Ruby on Rails community</a> is one of the nicest and most open I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>


	<p>Ah well, two down, <a href="http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/">approximately 100 to go.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Stop Kicking The Enterprise</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2006/01/06/dont-shun-the-enterprise/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to agree with <a href="http://jroller.com/page/obie">Obie Fernandez</a> when he complains in his posting <a href="http://jroller.com/page/obie?entry=enterprise_is_not_an_insult">Enterprise Is Not An Insult</a> about some of the recent derision directed at the Enterprise lately from the avant garde in the  <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> community lately. The problem is most of the mockery comes over a misunderstanding that &#8220;enterprise&#8221; means    &#8220;insanely large&#8221;, which Obie points out is completely different from any definition used by people who actually work in enterprise software:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Plenty of us say &#8220;enterprise&#8221; when referring to internal-facing systems written by corporate IT departments and it doesn&#8217;t carry a stigma for being too large or too small, too simple or too complex. Enterprise projects might be large, take years, straddle business units and have global effects or they might be small, departmental efforts with only a handful of end users. So many factors influence the success of enterprise software in a given organization, only few of which have anything to do with technology.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Yes, there are large products that call themselves &#8220;enterprise-class software&#8221;, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that all enterprise software has to be big, slow, and hard to develop. But unfortunately, mocking the state of enterprise software has become an oft repeated <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/predicting_06_enterprise_is_the_new_legacy.php">dumb</a> <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/define_enterprise_in_10_words_or_less.php">joke</a> lately. This is like when a comedian throws out a laugh line &#8211; like slamming Microsoft or calling France &#8220;surrender monkeys&#8221; &#8211; to get a quick laugh; it&#8217;s funny at first but soon loses its novelty.</p>


	<p>Giving a definition of my own, &#8220;enterprise software&#8221; means &#8220;business software.&#8221; All businesses want to increase their profits, and they do that by reducing inefficiency (ie, &#8220;we can track all of our operations within Excel&#8221;) or expanding into new niches (ie, opening overseas offices or offereing new business). Enterprise or <acronym title="business to business">B2B</acronym> software &#8211; whether shrink-wrapped or custom &#8211; is what helps them get there. The best enterprise software becomes as essential as the <span class="caps">CEO</span> or infrastructure to a company&#8217;s success. And smart companies look to develop such software as quickly as possible, both to increase their profits quicker and gain advantage over their competitors. Yes, there is slow and clunky enterprise software, but there is also lightweight and rapidly developed enterprise software too. Speaking from personal experience, at <a href="http://www.alacra.com/">Alacra</a>, we work with a lot of vendors both large and small, and I can assure you that agility and <em>profitability</em> are far more important than slavish adherence to some awkward and enormous toolkit. Consider that the agile methodologies of <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a> and <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/">Scrum</a> were first heavily used in such large enterprise environments as Chrysler and Honeywell respectively. And I would argue that the success of such radically-new-at-the-time technology like the Web, <span class="caps">XML</span>, or Java was entirely due to the <span class="caps">B2B</span> community recognizing their value early and embracing them fully.</p>


	<p>Which is why I think the jokes have to stop; does Rails want to continue to present itself as a niche tool for small <acronym title="business to consumer">B2C</acronym> development or does it want to be a <span class="caps">B2B</span> player? Why have we gone from <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000479.html">Rails does too scale!</a> to <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/dont_scale_99999_uptime_is_for_walmart.php">Uptime is overrated?</a>
Yeah, 99.9999% uptime is overkill for almost all software, but if you&#8217;re going to sell to business you shouldn&#8217;t mock people if they want 99% uptime. They&#8217;re not whinging; they want to make your product an essential tool for their business. And so I think Rails needs to embrace enterprise needs. I think David is right to resist such code additions to the core, but I think it has a place in third-party contributed plugins and code snippets. To be an enterprise player, people will want to plug Rails into working legacy database schemas, handling composite keys, potentially even interfacing with back-end service-oriented architectures;  maybe even hacking lightweight support for such horrors as <span class="caps">SOAP</span> or <span class="caps">CORBA</span>. And I think such work is what Rails needs to really succeed. Maybe you think it&#8217;s selling out, but I&#8217;d rather see Ruby in the enterprise than C#. There is a middle ground between obscurity and (code) obesity; let&#8217;s not mock people for trying to find it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Good And Bad Customer Service</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is just a short note to express my appreciation of <a href="http://www.booqbags.com/">Booq Bags</a> for their astoundingly good customer service experience. My current laptop bag from them has developed a few rips in the outer nylon from general wear and tear, but they offer a trusting lifetime warranty program for their bags. And so, they&#8217;re sending me a new bag &#8211; a process made all easier that I was able to look up my original order on their site and submit a replacement claim electronically. I still had to send them a photo of the damage &#8211; they&#8217;re not naively trusting &#8211; but once they received that, I was cleared for a replacement. Furthermore, when my <a href="http://www.booqbags.com/Detail.bok?no=72">original bag</a> was not available in the color I wanted, they shipped me <a href="http://www.booqbags.com/Detail.bok?no=441">a free upgrade</a>, with all the decisions made by the person on the phone.</p>


	<p>In contrast, my Canon <span class="caps">S400</span> is unable to read any memory cards now (hence the lack of new photos). After reading over some boards, it seems the problem is related to a design defect within the camera itself, apparently fixable by replacing a cheap internal battery. Canon&#8217;s response has been customers out of warranty are out of luck and they should shell out $150 for a simple battery replacement procedure. It&#8217;s not the customer&#8217;s fault the camera has this specific defect, but Canon blames them anyway. What an excellent way to make money off existing customers without ever having to worry about keeping them&#8230; and of course, none of those customers will <a href="http://www.digitalcameratracker.com/archives/2005/12/09/canon-powershot-s400-user-review-at-photography-review.html">ever</a> <a href="http://www.metareview.com/product-canon-powershot-s400-4mp-digital-camera-w-3x-optical-zoom/B00008OE6I">complain</a> <a href="http://www.stevesforums.com/forums/view_topic.php?id=38477&#38;forum_id=15">in</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008OE6I/002-9373313-8659219?n=502394">online stores</a> <a href="http://reviews-zdnet.com.com/Canon_PowerShot_S400_Digital_Elph/4505-6501_16-20893290.html">and forums</a>. Right&#8230;</p>


	<p>So, I&#8217;m violently annoyed at Canon, but
<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">passionately overjoyed</a> with Booq. If anything, this experience illustrates the truly delightful thing about purchasing from small companies; they care intensely about the customer service experience and are willing to put their money where their mouths are. And they empower their employees to make the decisions to make that happen. Why do big companies get it so wrong?</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Fair enough. I guess the point I could&#8217;ve made a little more strongly was that both were cases of design defects becoming manifest in the product. Canon&#8217;s stance was to blame the consumer, even if they treated their cameras immaculately and the failure was not specifically wear and tear. Booq&#8217;s option was to accept responsibility for their bag design and the effects of it.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>The Future of Feeds</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2006/01/24/the-future-of-feeds/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, I made a <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/lists/6TeddyWayneandGregWayne.html">New Year&#8217;s Resolution</a> to write more postings to the blog, but I have failed abjectly at that so far sadly. January is sadly a busy month for me, and I usually don&#8217;t feel like coming home after a long day to stare at a computer screen some more. But occaisionally inspiration strikes, and I feel like sharing some thoughts I have about the future of Syndication via <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Atom feeds in the next few years.</p>


	<p>I have to agree with my company&#8217;s <span class="caps">CEO </span><a href="http://www.alacrablog.com/">Steve Goldstein</a> when he says that <a href="http://www.alacrablog.com/alacrablog/2006/01/trends_in_the_i.html">increasing <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom adoption will be one of the big trends in the information industry in 2006</a>. Speculating wildly, I think that 2006 will be <strong>The Year of <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Atom</strong>. And so, I&#8217;m going to make a few bold predictions of my own about the state of syndication and the software industry. To avoid spending even longer without posting to the blog, I have decided to not bother with <em>research</em>, so if something I have predicted has actually <em>happened</em> already, be sure to make a snarky comment about it  to me below. Thanks. And now here are big things I see happening in the next year or so:</p>


	<p><strong>Mainstream Feed Adoption</strong> &#8211; Currently, most of the sites producing feeds are still blogs and news sites â€“- those for whom the article paradigm within feeds is a natural fit. However, non-newsy sites like <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> have earned a lot of buzz not just for their front-end interfaces but for their innovative and pervasive use of feeds <em>everywhere</em> and using syndication for non-article content. But this is still under the radar of the typical Internet user for now. I think this will change this year. I expect a major online site to follow suit this year and provide syndication of their data in a similar fashion. For instance, I would not be surprised if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> began to offer feeds for user wishlists or upcoming recommendations or music alerts. That would rock.</p>


	<p><strong>More People Will Embrace <span class="caps">RSS</span>, But Still Not Know It</strong> &#8211; A survey from last year by Yahoo! revealed that <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/06/01/01/1424220.shtml?tid=126">only 4% of Internet users knew what <span class="caps">RSS</span> was</a>, but this will most certainly change. The name is obviously somewhat to blame (there&#8217;s a joke that if it were called SpeedFeed more people would use it), but I think it&#8217;s not the real problem. In truth, most people just don&#8217;t care. For your typical web user, the Web is a toy more than a place to siphon information from; they are therefore not exactly vexed enough by the slowness of visiting sites to want to setup an aggregator. Instead, I think some different killer app beyond mere aggregation will be the only thing to make most people want to use <span class="caps">RSS</span>. I have no idea what that app might be, but I&#8217;m sure one of you could think of something awesome.</p>


	<p><strong>RSS Is A Terrible Business Though</strong> &#8211; For companies that produce or sell content, <span class="caps">RSS</span> will be a good fit, providing additional ways for users to access the site and contributing a small boost in sales or page visits. But companies in the <span class="caps">RSS</span> software business (particularly online aggregators) will have a terrible time. There are just very few barriers to entry for competitors, and the whole <em>we&#8217;ll make money through advertising</em> model seems so very pre-boom to me. That said, there are still some promising markets for companies doing <span class="caps">RSS</span> software. Software that allows filters or other mechanisms for mitigating information overload from feeds will find a market. Bridges from the pull-based mechanism of <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom to push-based messaging services like <span class="caps">SMS</span>, Email, or IM will probably also do well. And of course, it would be smart for makers of web analytics software to also look at measuring conversions and clickthroughs from feed links.</p>


	<p><strong>Syndication Will Drive <span class="caps">REST </span>Web Services</strong> &#8211; One of the common complaints leveled against <a href="http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html">REST-based Web Services</a> is that the simple model of <a href="http://www.prescod.net/rest/encoding/">REST does not specify the <span class="caps">XML</span> representation for data</a> (unlike the case of <span class="caps">XML</span>-RPC and <span class="caps">SOAP</span>). This will never officially change, but I think it will become increasingly more common to see <span class="caps">REST </span>Web Services that return <span class="caps">RSS</span>-like data for searches. Indeed, throw in Amazon&#8217;s <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">OpenSearch extensions for <span class="caps">RSS</span></a> and you have support for presenting pagination within <span class="caps">RSS</span> documents. The practical upshot of this is that programmers can use the exact same code for <span class="caps">RSS</span>, Search Engine Plugins (<em>if any other engines besides A9.com support OpenSearch_</em>), and <span class="caps">REST</span>-based Web Services. More significantly, this makes <span class="caps">REST</span> more compelling to these programmers, since supporting <span class="caps">SOAP</span>&#8217;s data encoding would require supporting an additional data format for searches and more code to implement. Similarly, the arrival of the <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/12/07/catching-up-with-the-atom-publishing-protocol.html">Atom Publishing Protocol</a> will also bring awareness of <span class="caps">REST </span>Web Services to a wider market of people who will be using it without even knowing it.</p>


	<p><strong>Feed Extensions Will Get Wider Support</strong> &#8211; As <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom grows in its usage, it should be possible to find more aggregators and process that also support the more popular extensions to feeds (these are normally specified within the document in a separate namespace). I think a few extensions will become essential in the years ahead (and I don&#8217;t even know if they exist currently!): support for threading of <span class="caps">RSS</span> items (for feeds based on email lists); partial encryption of <span class="caps">RSS</span> documents to be decrypted in the reader (would allow banks to offer feeds for instance); geographic tagging for marking stories (see the breaking news/photos on a map). In any event, I think good aggregators will show in some fashion all tags embedded in the feed so that users could search or filter based upon them.</p>


	<p><strong>Syndication in the Enterprise</strong> &#8211; Finally, it is obvious that <span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom will become more common within corporate intranets as well. And the <a href="/articles/2005/09/23/rss-comes-to-the-enterprise">credit for this belongs to Microsoft</a> of all companies. Mainly, by placing <span class="caps">RSS</span> within all aspects of Windows Vista, Microsoft will drag all sorts of big <span class="caps">IT </span>Departments into accepting <span class="caps">RSS</span> as a solution for messaging and event notification. This will in turn make them more likely to also accept other solutions based on syndication. In fact, I&#8217;m optimistic enough to think that <span class="caps">B2B </span>Syndication-based products will do better than <span class="caps">B2C </span>(remember that vexing 4% recognition rate from above; CTOs can mandate use in their companies). Smaller companies will be quick to embrace the immediacy of <span class="caps">RSS</span> and larger companies will also enjoy it for Windows Vista integration.</p>


	<p><strong>Atom vs. <span class="caps">RSS2</span>.0 Holy Wars Won&#8217;t Matter</strong> I know it vexes some readers of this posting that I&#8217;m using <span class="caps">RSS</span> sometimes as a shorthand phrase for <span class="caps">RSS2</span>.0 or Atom-based syndication. And I agree with them that Atom is technically superior while <span class="caps">RSS2</span>.0 has better market share. But my ultimate feeling is that the differences between the two for the consumer will be largely academic (like caring about whether your audio player is playing <span class="caps">MP3</span> or <span class="caps">AAC</span>), since any good aggregator or processor should just be able to handle both formats effortlessly.</p>


	<p>I will probably follow up on some of these points in more depth anon, but feel free to comment and quibble in the comments section below. I am no industry expert, but I do so like to make guesses about the business. And I&#8217;m curious what you think as well. Check in next year and we&#8217;ll how well they turned out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>This is a very interesting post. I thought that you might be interested to know that Stepwebz.com (http://www.stepwebz.com), a provider of online content solutions for webmasters and bloggers, launched a survey about <span class="caps">RSS</span> and content syndication. The survey aims to find out how webmasters, bloggers, marketers, publishers and advertisers could use <span class="caps">RSS</span> to:
- Increase content visibility and exposure
- Monetize syndicated content
- Share content with others (readers and websites)
- and much more</p>


	<p>You can complete the survey on the following page:

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you own a dog in New York, you&#8217;re probably very familiar with the sentiment of the title. New York has &#8220;pooper scooper laws&#8221; that require all dog walkers to clean up after their dogs. It&#8217;s not really pleasant to clean up after my dog, but it&#8217;s something I accept as part of owning her. It&#8217;s simply being considerate to my fellow person, but especially to my fellow dog owner; when someone doesn&#8217;t clean up, it makes all of us look bad.</p>


	<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s a result of fatigue from having stayed up late the night before fixing an urgent bug, but the next morning at the dog run with <a href="http://www.dogster.com/?26541">Bella</a> this seemed like a remarkably good aphorism about taking responsibility as as a programmer.</p>


	<p>I can&#8217;t really give details, but I was up the night before fixing an extremely critical bug. I was fixing the bug because it was my fault. And I was fixing it that night because it was vitally important it not inconvenience customers any further (it had already affected them for a few days). And the bug was completely my fault, not the code&#8217;s, not the operating system&#8217;s, not my coworkers&#8217; or the QA testers&#8217;, all mine. And this is what I told my boss and my coworkers, and this is what I think was also told to the customers.</p>


	<p>This may sound like I am only pointing out what&#8217;s natural (like tooting my horn about how my heart is able to speed up when I exercise). But from my experience, software developers are horrible at handling failure. We blame it on the language we write in, the overwhelming complexity of our tasks, those testers we expect to find all our bugs for us or those project managers we expect to manage all our time for us. When we fall behind on deliverables, most of us keep silent and vainly hope we can catch up before the next milestone (a mistake so common it&#8217;s earned the euphemism <em>hope creep</em> among project managers). And when we mess up technically in front of the customer, we mask it in euphemisms like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&#38;tag=httpwwwnimbco-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F073571410X">a technical error has occurred</a> whose passive voice make the customer wonder if they&#8217;re being blamed and if errors just magically fall from the sky like rain.</p>


	<p>To be fair, taking responsibility hurts. It damages your pride, makes you look bad for the moment, and might almost feel like a <em>career-limiting move</em>. But as Chad Fowler puts it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&#38;tag=httpwwwnimbco-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0976694018%2Fqid%3D1138914507%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">My Job Went To India</a>, you must <strong>learn how to fail</strong>. Your managers might be pissed at the moment but I think honesty as well as concrete plan for fixing things and taking action will impress them. Your customers might be annoyed but will appreciate your forthrightness instead of fuzziness when explaining what broke and will love it if you can make things right as soon as possible instead of a few months. It&#8217;s good for your fellow developers because it fights the cynicism and despair that result from too much unapologetically bad software already. And it&#8217;s good for your character. You will actually turn out the stronger for having taken your lumps and emerging from it.</p>


	<p>So, the next time something breaks (and there will be a next time), embrace it. And if that&#8217;s too hard for you to do, get a different career; and don&#8217;t get a dog.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The Dangers of Heroes and Martyrs</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last posting, I riffed at dubious length about how taking responsibility for your code (from testing and maintenance through fighting fires in extreme situations) was a lot like <a href="/articles/2006/02/02/if-you-cant-scoop-the-poop-you-shouldnt-own-a-dog">cleaning up after your dog</a>&#8212;a frankly unpleasant task, but one that you owe to your colleagues and customers. More importantly, I feel you owe this obligation <em>especially</em> to your fellow software developers of all stripes, as we are all hurt by the cynicism that results from crappy code being left in the world.</p>


	<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the fact that I was out yesterday for an extremely rare sick day, but I&#8217;m feeling philosophical again today about a related yet opposite problem that also strikes software developers: the <strong>hero complex</strong>. And since I&#8217;m in this frame of metaphor, it&#8217;s time to return to dog poop to explain the craziness of the hero complex. When I&#8217;m at the dog run with Bella, I always clean up her mess. And occasionally I will go and clean up someone else&#8217;s if I&#8217;m feeling charitable. But what if I were to scour the dog run for all messes and clean them up, even if other owners there should be watching after their own dogs? What if I were to regularly go to the dog run at 3am in the odd chance that there might be some more poop I could clean up? What if I strutted around all proud because of my poop scoopery? What if I were to do all this because I was magically hoping for a commendation from the Parks Department? You&#8217;d think I was nuts, and yet this is exactly the kind of thinking that motivates the heroes and martyrs of software development.</p>


	<p>Scott Berkun&#8217;s excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&#38;tag=httpwwwnimbco-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0596007868%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1139335223%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">The Art of Project Management</a> is the only project management I&#8217;ve seen so far that talks about the dangers of this hero complex to software development. The problem with hero developers is that they derive their self esteem solely from their rescue efforts, and this can create some real problems for the software. It might encourage code to be released recklessly with little or no testing, because the developer feels he can fix all problems that occur. If the hero is really good, it might mask serious problems in the organization (a horrible testing process, other bad developers who really need to be replaced). Worst of all, the hero complex might lock the organization into a constant fire fighting mode, where all resources are allocated in reaction to things breaking on a regular basis, leading to poor strategic vision, a lack of energy for new projects, and ultimately complete burnout.</p>


	<p>The hero complex is ultimately a problem of self esteem. In a few cases, the hero has a huge ego, which leads himself to think he really can single-handedly tackle any grand challenges that come his way (hopefully he doesn&#8217;t take down the company in the process). This is usually what most people think of as the hero complex problem, where a charismatic cocksure loner takes everybody down with him. But for most developers, the hero complex emerges in a different fashion out of low self-esteem. We have no real idea what value we&#8217;re contributing to the company, because we only get feedback when things go wrong (negative and angry), and any positive feedback usually comes at most once a year in the form of a performance review. And so, many developers easily find themselves seeking out the positive acclaim through the hero complex. But many more find themselves sacrificing more and more of their selves to curry favor with their bosses; I call this <strong>the martyr complex</strong>.  For instance, you might find yourself volunteering to clean up and cover for other people&#8217;s messes, because you&#8217;re worried you&#8217;re not enough of a &#8220;team player.&#8221; You head into the office very early and work late, grab more things to be responsible for without any additional pay or help, get added to pager duty for evenings and weekends, even stagger in with a high fever from the flu â€“- all of this is considered worth it for getting your boss&#8217; notice and praise. Which is crazy, because your boss most likely doesn&#8217;t care (or you work for a soulless tyrant who thinks you should put him before your own family). No offense, but you usually don&#8217;t matter as much to the company as you think you do. You need to redefine your self-esteem.</p>


	<p>But isn&#8217;t the alternative just nihilism? No, you instead need to develop a true sense of what you contribute to the company and how the company in turn contributes to your career path. I hope to delve into my own experiences and my own dabbling in martyrdom. But that&#8217;s a subject for another time&#8230;</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems like it was only yesterday that I was loudly praising <a href="/articles/2005/12/14/amazon-shakes-things-up">the bold moves Amazon was making in search</a>, but now that is probably going to end. The head of Amazon&#8217;s A9 search service Udi Manber has <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002325.php">jumped ship to Google</a>. Bummer for Amazon. I guess Google is becoming the Microsoft of search, scooping up everybody eventually.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am aware there is something so deeply ironic about this, but I wanted to share a great link about the practice of blogging titled <a href="http://blogs.earthlink.net/2006/02/a_great_cd_is_not_a_failed_rad.php">A Great <span class="caps">CD </span>Is Not A Failed Radio Station</a>.
If you&#8217;re a blogger, you should read it. You can go there now, I&#8217;ll wait.</p>


	<p>Most blogs suck. They don&#8217;t really say anything new. This is largely because search engines, aggregators, and advertising models all encourage quantity over quality &#8211; many short and quick observations over long analysis. Search engines love <em>freshness</em> in content, and fresh posts mean more clicks means more advertising revenue. And so, many people labor strenuously to post <strong>daily</strong> to their blogs, even if this <a href="http://contentious.com/archives/2005/06/13/more-on-why-daily-blogging-really-is-usually-a-bad-idea">makes their writing suffer.</a></p>


	<p>The problem is that like any writing, blogging takes time and mental energy, and if you find yourself having to write daily or more, your blog postings will usually become little more than &#8220;me too&#8221; or &#8220;check this out&#8221; declarations &#8211; filler content with no real additional thought or analysis. This reductive trend is accelerated by the desire to want to be the <em>first post</em> to comment or link to something new on the web. This leads to initial kneejerk appraisals on big stories instead of more thoughtful analysis days later when the story is &#8220;old.&#8221; And so, the reckless pursuit of <em>freshness</em> in blog content only encourages <em>staleness</em> in the ideas on those pages. And the Internet begins to resemble Sunday political talk shows with their empty talking-points and flip-reactions.</p>


	<p>As you can see from my posting schedule, I&#8217;m hardly a victim of this syndrome (I&#8217;ll call it Premature Blogification). But if you find yourself on a never-ending race to keep up posting to your blog, maybe you should try a change. Get the Blogging Monkey off your back and embrace quality and sanity again. Your readers will love it. And so will you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lost in the last few weeks in the incessant coverage over Dick Cheney&#8217;s decision to <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/45572">hunt the ultimate prey</a> were some interesting revelations about the <span class="caps">NSA</span>&#8217;s new mechanisms for spying on electronic communications. The Christian Science Monitor broke this story first, report on <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0209/p01s02-uspo.html?s=hns">a system named <span class="caps">ADVISE</span> that would spider blogs, wishlists and other relics of online presence to build up dossiers on people</a>. Some people thought that <span class="caps">ADVISE</span> was <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002342.php">simply the rejected Total Information Awareness (TIA) program in new clothing</a>, but Newsweek in a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11238800/site/newsweek/print/1/displaymode/1098/">truly excellent work of reporting</a> broke the information that <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/02/11/tia-lives/">the core of <span class="caps">TIA</span> was actually renamed to a project called Topsail</a> and <span class="caps">ADVISE</span> was something else. <span class="caps">TIA</span>&#8217;s core motivation was to simply scan communications for &#8220;suspicious activities&#8221; and then notify human analysts of potential problems. <span class="caps">ADVISE</span> seems to have a much grander scope of building up dossiers of people&#8217;s interests and intents to identify &#8220;suspicious people&#8221; instead. Yikes.</p>


	<p>In some sense, this is nothing new. Way back in 1993, the <span class="caps">NSA</span> made waves by trying to pass through a mandatory encryption standard called <a href="http://www.epic.org/crypto/clipper/">the Clipper chip</a> that would enable the government to decrypt any encrypted communications and the <a href="http://fly.hiwaay.net/~pspoole/echres.html">Echelon</a> project has been steadily accumulating intercepted electronic communications under the <span class="caps">NSA</span>&#8217;s purview. But the <span class="caps">NSA</span> has always had issues analyzing the volume of messages they grab and very, very little of the data they retrieve ever makes its way in front of an analyst. Making light of this, some Emacs developer even added a feature <strong>M-x spook</strong> that would spit out a series of suspicious words suitable for activists to add to their email and overwhelm the already overstrained capabilities of the government like so:</p>


	<p><em>top secret <span class="caps">SAFE</span> terrorist <span class="caps">ANZUS </span>New World Order enforcers radar <span class="caps">TELINT </span>Serbian advisors <span class="caps">FIPS140 INSCOM</span> government <span class="caps">CNCIS</span> secure</em></p>


	<p>But here we are again, with the government claiming a need to spy on us and the media leading a fight against it. If it continues like it has though, we fighting this are destined to lose. The problem is that most of the ensuing discussion of the government&#8217;s data mining operations have been like those for the wire tapping scandal; criticism is focused on the political and ethical problems of the systems and <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200512240002">lies are exposed</a>, but the underlying technical problems are glossed over by tech-averse journalists. Indeed, most discussions on the legality of wire tapping implicitly assume that the technology is completely effective but should be avoided strictly out of moral concerns. To see what I mean, recall how the debate over torture that started last year played out in newspapers and TV shows. The &#8220;anti-torture&#8221; side would start the argument by positing the moral horror of torture. The &#8220;pro-torture&#8221; side would almost always then counter with a hypothetical situation of capturing a mastermind who we are unquestionably certain knows about a master plot to destroy an American city and from whom torture is the <em>only</em> way to get such information. The torture advocate thus sidesteps the moral horrors of the situation by claiming there is no viable alternative. Of course, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2302-2005Jan11.html">such situations never happen and torture rarely ever yields true information</a>, but that&#8217;s besides the point. The argument is thus glibly reduced to &#8220;idealists vs. pragmatists&#8221;, and in these times the pragmatists always win the debate for public opinion.</p>


	<p>This process will likely happen again with the debate over data mining. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11238800/site/newsweek/print/1/displaymode/1098/">That Newsweek article</a> does an exemplary job of exploring the technical issues, but they&#8217;re an exception to the rule. The pragmatists will advance the argument that nobody really like spying on Americans, but it&#8217;s the only way to catch the bad guys. And this is what makes me really upset. It&#8217;s bad enough that data mining is likely illegal and invasive, but even more galling that the system most likely will never work in the first place.</p>


	<p><em>eavesdropping emc <span class="caps">ARPA HAMASMOIS </span>Aldergrove <span class="caps">AGT</span>. AMME Freeh White House jihad csystems <span class="caps">MIT</span>-LL 22nd <span class="caps">SAS NWO</span> pink noise mania</em></p>


	<p>So, what are the technical problems that make such a system unfeasible? For starters, this isn&#8217;t actually data mining. I used to work at a data mining software developer (<a href="http://www.dimins.com/">Dimensional Insight</a>) and the goal of those products was to organize complicated data into easily traversable ways for analysts to drill down for connections. In a typical case, you might want to look over your sales data for the last year to see how products sold in particular parts of the country, which sales divisions did best, or similar queries. The process is human-driven and its sole purpose is to represent complex multi-dimensional data (ie, price, product, sales person, city, region, state, time, correlation to other product sales, etc.) in an easily viewable and usable manner to drill down through the data for connections. In addition, data mining involves looking backwards from the present to gain insight into past purchasing patterns to drive future sales (the classic success story is <a href="http://www.dmreview.com/article_sub.cfm?articleId=1006133">a supermarket finding a correlation between diaper and beer sales</a>).</p>


	<p>Instead, the <span class="caps">NSA</span> largely seems to be interested in predicting novel future behavior and retrieving warnings when suspicious activities occur. This is actually more in line with Artificial Intelligence research on classifiers. Essentially what the <span class="caps">NSA</span> seems to be striving for is some sort of theoretical Threat Box which can be fed a steady stream of events and spit out a warning for human analysts to follow up in certain cases. Whether the backend classifier is a neural net, support vector machine, or other sort of technology, the process of training classifiers usually includes the same parts. First, a <strong>training set</strong> needs to be assembled out of a mixture of scored positive and negative events. So, if you were creating a &#8220;terrorist email classifier&#8221;, the positive events might be emails from Osama Bin Ladin, the negative would be emails from your Aunt Sue (there are usually many more negative than positive selections). When the testing is done, a similarly pre-classified <strong>testing set</strong> is used to evaluate how good the classifier actually is. The goal of a well-trained set is to make the correct correlations between certain inputs (so that the presence of &#8220;bomb&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;house&#8221; triggers an alarm), but a constant risk with such systems is the danger of erroneously assuming certain correlations are meaningful (eg, all of Mohammed Atta&#8217;s emails included the word &#8220;the&#8221;, so the system concludes that &#8220;the&#8221; indicates the email is dangerous). To minimize such problems, both the training and test sets usually go through a process of <strong>feature selection</strong>, where meaningless information is filtered out so it doesn&#8217;t affect the classifier. If this sounds like more of an art than a science, it is and there are several ways in which errors can manifest:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Human Bias &#8211; people are necessary to select and classify the training and test sets as well as feature selection. This can create biases in the system that reflect the assumptions of the creators. As Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060206fa_fact">excellent article on profiling</a> explored, such biases create systems that solve the wrong problems and vulnerabilities exploitable by intelligent attackers.</li>
		<li>Too Little Human Bias &#8211; on the opposite end of the spectrum, it&#8217;s possible to have too much faith in the effectiveness of a classifier. The difficulty here is that the judgement of the computer will be accepted as absolute. One problem is that it generally is impossible to extricate any clear explanation of the classification&#8217;s reasoning (any explanation is like teasing out thought at the neuron level, making it too low-level to be sensible). Furthermore, even if such explanations were available, the experience with the <span class="caps">TSA</span>&#8217;s No Fly Lists suggests they would not be made available to agents acting on the classifier output. At best, this would only mean that the <span class="caps">NSA</span> is inundated with erroneous data. At worst, it could lead to extensive spying, internment, and misguided strategic directions. Best not to contemplate this further.</li>
		<li>False Positives and Negatives &#8211; any classification system usually contains some mix of false positives and negatives. In this system, the political pressures seem to mandate that the false negatives (ie, missing a threat) should be 0 if at all possible. Unfortunately, minimizing the false negatives invariably increases the false positives, meaning that more events will be erroneously triggered. For the dangers this presents, look at item #2.</li>
		<li>The Wrong Tool For the Job &#8211; Even if the classifier were able to achieve a remarkable level of correctness and accuracy, it&#8217;s still possible it would be the wrong tool for the job. As one blog has observed, <a href="http://alexandertheaverage.blogspot.com/2006/02/nsa-scandal-got-you-worried-then-i.html">Osama Bin Ladin probably isnâ€™t clicking around on Amazon</a>, meaning that these tools for signal intelligence won&#8217;t be very useful if the enemy is not creating any signals for them to detect. How likely are terrorist cells going to be using email when you can fedex or hand-deliver documents anywhere around the globe in a few days? How hard is it to exploit steganography or misdirection to thwart any tracking systems? In this case, this elaborate <span class="caps">NSA</span> system just becomes another example of America&#8217;s heavy reliance on technology (smart bombs, sigint, spy satellites) over the crude and dirty human-based methods of gathering information and waging war. How many gaps in our knowledge will this system ever fill? Or are there other ways to more effectively gather information for the cost of building this surveillance infrstructure?</li>
	</ol>


	<p><em>freedom Kennedy chameleon man mindwar <span class="caps">BROMURE </span>Echelon <span class="caps">TELINT </span>Armani Marxist Bletchley Park <span class="caps">FIPS140</span> nuclear supercomputer mania <span class="caps">USDOJ</span></em></p>


	<p>Of course, the <span class="caps">NSA</span> will claim their systems are effective and already performing vital tasks in the war on terror. Indeed, the article about <span class="caps">ADVISE</span> reports &#8220;the system &#8211; parts of which are operational, parts of which are still under development &#8211; is already credited with helping to foil some plots.&#8221; But what are the nature of these plots? Even if I give the <span class="caps">NSA</span> credit and assume they aren&#8217;t being duplicitous about current problems in the hopes they can fix them later (a condition known as <em>hope creep</em>), I wonder if the same circular logic presented in the case of Guantanamo Bay detainees will also be applied here: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4708946.stm">Guantanamo Bay is only for Al Qaeda terrorists, therefore everybody interred there must be a dangerous terrorist</a>. Again, what are these thwarted attacks? Are they real, orchestrated and viable or just some bored teens talking smack on MySpace? Such information will never be made publicbecause the <span class="caps">NSA</span> needs foiled plots to justify the system and thus any vagule plausible detected messages will become foiled terrorist plots. Meanwhile we lurch closer to national insolvency, confident in our abilities to detect the next 9/11 if only those darn terrorists would play by our expected rules. And we lay the groundwork of a national surveillance state, just ready to be exploited by some avaricious future leaders.</p>


	<p>So, what is to be done? I wish there was something. If the stakes were not so high, I&#8217;d suggest that it might be worthwhile to update M-x spook with a whole new lexicon to sabotage the surveillance mechanisms now before more money is thrown into the whole. But these are no times for pranksters, and the only real solution is for Congress to exert the oversight they have. They killed <span class="caps">TIA</span> one already and the could do it again. The oversight is theirs; if only they had the courage and the wisdom to use it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, I won&#8217;t deny that this is a new category of postings inspired directly by Slashdot&#8217;s notion of <a href="http://slashdot.org/search.pl?tid=167">Slashbacks</a>, short little postings that track followups to previous postings as well as miscellaneous tiny bits that don&#8217;t warrant their own postings, but are still above the level of <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/people/harrisj/bookmarks">bookmarks</a> or Kottke&#8217;s <a href="http://kottke.org/remainder/">remaindered links</a>. I still am a firm adherent of <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/02/16/original-blogging-content">Slow Bloggging</a>, but I like to update notable developments to previous postings too.</p>

	<p>Impressive computer security expert Bruce Schneier has posted his own similar analysis on the excessive confidence being placed on data mining as a counterterrorism tool (<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/03/data_mining_for.html">Data Mining For Terrorists</a>) that&#8217;s worth a read. Not only is it smart, it&#8217;s well-written to boot.</p>


	<p>Of course, Congress did have a chance this week to assert some oversight over domestic spying and the like. And what action it was, as they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/09/opinion/09thur1.html?_r=1&#38;hp&#38;oref=slogin">promptly rolled over to avoid any possible political embarrasment for the <span class="caps">GOP</span></a>.

	<p>The Emerging Technology conference has concluded and there have been several nice talks posted. One of the major themes this year was discussion about the <strong>Attention Economy</strong>, how to cope with information overload and rise to the top.

	<p>I brought my Canon camera back to life last weekend. All it took was removing the outer case, extracting an internal hidden battery and replacing it after an hour to reset some internal component. That&#8217;s it. Luckily I&#8217;m not scared of opening up electronics, but it still galls me that Canon charges $175 to do this very thing, The disposable mentality behind consumer electronics still mystifies me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Damen, the camera in question is a Canon <span class="caps">S400</span>, although the problem apparently affects several cameras in the line. Basically after a few years or so, you start getting a &#8220;Memory Card Error&#8221; that cripples the camera. This is apparently more of an issue with an internal component and not the card and resetting the battery seems to force a hard reset and cleanup corruption I guess.</p>


	<p>This is not my first time opening up electronics and while I&#8217;m not really at the level of <a href="http://www.makezine.com/" rel="nofollow">Make Magazine</a>, I&#8217;m not scared by it and I enjoy it to some degree. I repaired an original airport base station that went under because of defective capacitors and it&#8217;s been working fine since. Still, for most people and most consumers, the prevailing attitude seems to be throw it out rather than repair it. And who can blame them? The entire consumer electronics business is built upon a churn of people upgrading their stuff before it&#8217;s broken or even that much obsolete.</p>


	<p>Funnily enough, opening up a camera like this really shows you how much business there is between ostensible rivals even. The <span class="caps">LCD</span> display said Sony on it and there were quite a few Samsung components on the memory board.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d like to apologize for the silence on this blog. Way back in the days before <a href="http://www.measuremap.com/">MeasureMap</a> I used to feel like I had to keep writing for my many regular readers (all 12 of you as I now know), but the inspiration has just not been there recently. It hasn&#8217;t helped that I have been out of town on 2 separate occasions and with enough work to keep me busy and focused. But I also have been purposefully staying away from my blog. It&#8217;s not that I can&#8217;t find things to post about, it&#8217;s just that I haven&#8217;t felt they&#8217;re really interesting enough to say (I like to do more than belabor the obvious).</p>


	<p>I hope to return with more content in the future, but this period of lying fallow has been immensely inspirational and productive in so many other ways; in short, it might be a while. Thanks again for your continued patronage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Rubyisms In Rails</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an apparently blatant attempt to be more like <a href="http://www.slash7.com/">Amy Hoy</a>, I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time I did some Intro to Rails writing. Tonight I&#8217;m going to be giving a little talk on what I&#8217;m calling <strong>Rubyisms</strong> as seen in Ruby on Rails. I think one of the things that makes Rails so cool is how it is built upon some of the best aspects of Ruby&#8217;s style: duck typing, symbols, blocks, and metaprogramming. And yet, I think many newcomers to Rails don&#8217;t really notice some of the magic going on behind such simple declarations as</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby "><span class="punct">&lt;%</span> <span class="number">30</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">minutes</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">from_now</span> <span class="punct">%&gt;</span><span class="string"></span></code></pre></div>

	<p>or more complicated Rails cases like</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby "><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="class">Review</span> <span class="punct">&lt;</span> <span class="constant">ActiveRecord</span><span class="punct">::</span><span class="constant">Base</span>
  <span class="ident">belongs_to</span> <span class="symbol">:article</span>
  <span class="ident">validates_presence_of</span> <span class="symbol">:author</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></code></pre></div>

	<p>My humble little slideshow goes out to those Rails newcomers hacking code to look like <span class="caps">PHP</span> or Java. The conceit is to use some sample Rails code as starting points for deeper explorations into some of the Ruby coolness lurking inside Rails. This is a nice little look under the hood, but I hope it will educate people new to Rails on how to embrace Ruby style for cleaner and <em>cooler</em> code.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m posting the slides early for some last minute feedback and I might update these files if any other errors are found. I&#8217;d like to thank <a href="http://www.nycruby.org/">NYC.rb</a> compatriots <a href="http://www.zonageek.com/">Sebastian Delmont</a>, <a href="http://locomotive.raaum.org/home/show/HomePage">Ryan Raaum</a>, <a href="http://www.lifecoding.com/">Trotter Cashion</a>, and <a href="http://www.rubypowerandlight.com/">David Black</a> for their help and corrections as well.</p>


	<p>The presentation itself is two parts. I&#8217;m releasing it here in two style. The <em>light version</em> is stripped of interstitial chapter screens and is a lot easier on the bandwidth:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="/files/rubynewbies-lite.pdf">PDF Version</a></li>
		<li><a href="/files/rubynewbies-lite.swf">Flash Version</a> (<strong>Note</strong>: Flash version is cutting off bottoms of some slides)</li>
	</ul>


	<p>If you like what you see there and want to get the version I&#8217;m presenting with images, the full 2MB <span class="caps">PDF</span> dump is also available:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="/files/rubynewbies.pdf">Huge <span class="caps">PDF </span>Version</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>Anyhow, I hope you enjoy my little presentation, and as always feedback and corrections are welcome in the comments.</p>


	<h3>Update (8/2/06)</h3>


	<p>This presentation is now available for sale as a <a href="http://www.informit.com/shortcuts">digital shortcut from Informit</a> (54 pages, $9.99).

  <title>The Right Kind of Stupidity</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">New Yorker</a> had an interesting article on the rapid growth and addictive appeal of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> among college students today. Users admit they generally waste too much time viewing the site and obsessively updating their profiles. As one user puts it</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Quote about time wasting</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>This view is reinforced later by an anthropologist who intially characterizes the site&#8217;s users as voyeurs and exhibitionists, and indeed that is the conventional view taken of such sites as MySpace and Facebook and 43Things by the media and large parts of the public &#8211; the entire Internet is nothing more than a unregulated and pointless updating of <a href="http://www.laurashin.com/noexit.html">We Live in Public</a>.   And it&#8217;s a fear that even the most confirmed Web2.0 heads wonder if all this filling out data everywhere is really worth it.</p>


	<p>But after thinking it over, the anthropologist reconsiders and decides posting content on Facebook is a lot like hanging out in malls. It is not so much an exercise in undirected exhibitionism but an active effort at social connection &#8211; albeit without the same direct purpose as dating or professional networking.</p>


	<p>Which brings me to my title. I was trying to think of a good reason why some Web2.0 sites have proven to be so popular. And that&#8217;s when I</p>

  <title>Three Novels For Programmers</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple weekends ago, I went on a trip up to the People&#8217;s Republic of Cambridge, Massachusetts. While my wife was at a conference, I spent my time writing, thinking, and catching up with a few old friends from <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a> about all the things that have been going on while I&#8217;ve been here in New York: changes to campus life, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/evolving/buildings/stata/">hideous new architecture</a>, <a href="http://hacks.mit.edu/">notable hacks</a>, and the fact that my beloved dorm of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/senior-house/www/">Senior House</a> still seems to be the same merry land of malcontents and eccentrics. We talked about many other things, but I recall most clearly the talk about books.</p>


	<p>The common stereotype of computer nerds is that we spend all of our non-technical reading time with noses deep in cheap mass-market science fiction paperbacks featuring lizard men, busty women, and spaceships pointing phallicly towards a planet. But this seems more of a cheap joke than a deep truth; the geeks I know love novels. And so, in an attempt to convince the world that computer people have a special depth, I&#8217;m starting my own version of a <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006389.html">book meme</a> and naming three notable books along a theme and why I like them. I know this is of course what is known as <em>filler</em> in blog land, but it might be fun anyway. So, first up in my listing is <strong>three excellent novels for computer scientists that aren&#8217;t science fiction</strong>:</p>


	<p><span style="float:left;display:block;padding:5px;"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0312423136.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" alt="" /></span> <strong>Galatea 2.2</strong> by Richard Powers is a wistful and intriguing book about a writer named &#8220;Richard Powers&#8221; who returns from a failed life in Holland for a directionless sabbatical at a Midwestern university. While there, he becomes involved with a project in the university&#8217;s large Computer Science department to teach an Artificial Intelligence named Helen about art, literature and beauty. The result is an exploration of identity, consciousness and the emotional connections we feel with machines, made the more interesting by the intermingling of the author&#8217;s real and fictional personas in the book.</p>


	<p><span style="float:right;display:block;padding:5px;"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567920977.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.gif" alt="" /></span> <strong>Mefisto</strong> by John Banville is a hypnotic retelling of the Faust story from Ireland&#8217;s best contemporary writer. The book comprise two symmetric episodes of the life of a main character gifted in mathematics who falls into the orbit of a seductively mysterious man. Equivalences, symbols and symmetry (it&#8217;s no coincidence the book begins and ends with the word &#8220;chance&#8221;) make for some interesting connections without the gimmicky annoyances of more experimental textual structure. Those of the scientific bent may also prefer Banville&#8217;s books <em>Kepler</em> and <em>Copernicus</em>.</p>


	<p><span style="float:left;display:block;padding:5px;"><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0140188592.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" alt="" /></span> <strong>Gravity&#8217;s Rainbow</strong> by Thomas Pynchon is a mess of a book. Ostensibly dealing with a mystery about the V-2 rockets at the end of World War II, it becomes a grand descent into some disparate subjects as chemicals, sado-masochism, conditioning, identity, race, and an immortal lightbulb. It might not make complete sense the first time through (or even subsequent times), but it definitely is a dense exercise in style unmatched by any. Besides, any novel that can inspire <a href="http://www.themodernword.com/pynchon/zak_smith/title.htm">cool art</a> like this can&#8217;t be bad.</p>


	<p>What&#8217;s the next <strong>Three</strong>? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe poetry for pretentious people or weird books that mix text and pictures.  Feel free to do your own or make a suggestion below.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a lot of feeds. A <em>lot</em> of feeds. In my hobby trend-spotting (it&#8217;s like a dorkier birdwatching), I read my feeds to monitor the zeitgeist to see what the real <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/05/14/oreilly_wwdc_keynote.html">Alpha Geeks</a> are into. And the last year has had some interesting trends. For instance, dynamic languages like Python and Ruby are now firmly the new wave, although functional languages (Haskell, <span class="caps">OCAML</span>) and prototype languages (Io) seem to also be attracting interest. Web2.0 is a term bandied around casually, mocked, and even <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/web_20_service_mark_controvers.html">litigated over</a> , but the concept seems to be here to stay. The most novel aspect I&#8217;ve seen about Web2.0 is that the Web has become a source of real tools many developers are using to manage their lives; as a holder of Sun stock much diminished in value, I guess I can at least take comfort in the fact that their adage &#8220;The network is the computer&#8221; seems to finally be coming true. Sure, it&#8217;s about 6 years later than predicted, but it&#8217;s happening.</p>


	<p>But most interesting to me is when the alpha geeks flock to ideas not directly related to coding frameworks, business plans or the like. For instance, six months ago it seemed like every serious hacker was devouring <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a> and blogging about organizing their lives. And now the new obsession is <a href="http://web.ionsys.com/~remedy/FLOW%20%20.htm">Flow</a>. A conceptualiztion first coined in a book fifteen years ago, Flow is a term Mihaly Csiksczentmihalyi (<em>don&#8217;t ask me to pronounce that</em>) coined for that mental state where work is  stimulating but not frustrating, intention translates effortlessly into action, and happiness and productivity are intertwined. Csiksczentmihalyi teased out a description of Flow by looking at the mental states of people practicing Zen mindfulness or risking bodily harm in extreme sports like rock-climbing or surfing. But he could just as easily described the euphoric states of serious computer programming. Small wonder this  book has now been &#8220;discovered&#8221; by the alpha geeks, this fleeting feeling is what we find so addictive about programming in the first place.</p>


	<p><span style="float:right;display:block;padding:5px;"><img src="http://www.nimblecode.com/files/flow_channel.jpg" alt="" /></span> The basic concept of Flow is that certain tasks make us happy to do them because they exist within a narrow channel between fear and boredom, because they encourage us to improve our skills but do not overwhelm us with too many challenges at once (<em>for Donnie Darko fans, the goal of flow is to find the middle of the fear-love axis</em>). We developers are well-acquainted with that fear. It&#8217;s the fear that keeps you from refactoring that legacy system because you&#8217;re not sure what would break, the fear that keeps us using a clunky library because we can&#8217;t test changes, the fear that makes deploying the new version to the server nail-biting because it&#8217;s crammed full of changes that might take it down. In short, fear and specifically <em>fear of change</em> is a constant state of mind for too many programmers, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. A state of happiness is possible if you can conquer the fear.</p>


	<p>Flow is the reason why some frameworks like Ruby on Rails are so appealing to programmers; it straddles that line between utter boredom (coding a web site in <span class="caps">PHP</span> like always) and high anxiety (having to master a complicated system like Cocoon just to print out &#8220;Hello World&#8221;). The key is allowing people to add capabilities (like authentication, tagging) as their skills grow, but not require everything to be planned up front. It conquers the fear of change, but hacking change into smaller steps. What makes a framework <em>good</em> (the same is true for languages, methodologies, testing, architectures) is how it destroys this anxiety.</p>


	<p>For most of my career, the basic question asked of developers was <strong>are you productive?</strong> Computer programmers are naturally obsessed with productivity. This is after all a field where good programmers can outperform bad coders by several orders of magnitude. and for years the industry has marketed to this by selling tools that promise leaps in productivity. The key to productivity was seen only through uses of higher-level toolsets/IDEs or APIs. This is a philosophy Cote has memorably termed <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/archives/2006/05/oracle_develope.html">Right-Click Coding</a> because of all the right clicking and fiddling you have to do to get anywhere. This was seen as a development accelerator, because it enabled poor developers to do complicated things like enterprise integration and <span class="caps">GUI</span> development without needing to actually write code or learn details of how things work. But, I think that overall such tools have actually decreased developer productivity in several ways. Like a teacher teaching only to her worst students in class, the wizards and libraries stifle and frustrate more able programmers. And since they remove developers from using the underlying code, wizards only accelerate bloat and complexity in their underlying code bases.</p>


	<p>Worse of all, the fear was still out there. Indeed, like air conditioner output makes city streets hotter, they&#8217;ve made the situation worse. By piling away programming within massive APIs and single-purpose wizards, this approach has created a nightmare of complexity waiting to ambush more able developers. Now the question becomes <strong>are you compliant?</strong> Being savvy to the latest standards, libraries, or buzzwords is touted as the key. But the difficulties people have had using <span class="caps">SOAP</span> is but one example of how compliance doesn&#8217;t really help either.
Just mention &#8220;interop&#8221; to any <span class="caps">CTO</span> or high-level architect and you&#8217;ll see what I mean. The complexity (and the fear) are still there, standards compliance just blames the programmer when things go wrong.</p>


	<p>Instead, it&#8217;s time for a new question: <strong>are you happy?</strong> I think the growing interest in Flow and <span class="caps">GTD</span> and higher-level languages and test-driven development and agile project management reflects a sea change in attitude by the alpha geeks. Trying to find happiness through artificially increasing productivity is like putting the cart before the horse. The key point of Flow is not that productivity fights fear and creates happiness, but recognizing that creating happiness is what creates productivity. I think it&#8217;s about time, if we want to avoid the descent into compromises and disillusionment common in computer science. So, get in touch with your feelings when deciding about that design, language, system, api, etc. and ask yourself &#8220;am I happy doing this?&#8221; I think your instincts are a better guide than you know. Trust them. And don&#8217;t be afraid to be happy.</p>


	<p><strong>Update:</strong> I added some links to the original book as well as discussion in a <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/06/01/short-takes-pdas-planet-argon-and-happiness">short take posting</a>. Happy reading!</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I understand a lot of where you come from, but given my situation (<strong>cough</strong> unix operator <strong>cough</strong>) i am ecstatic being able to take a job developing using open-source languages on an open platform.</p>


	<p>For me, being able to use the right tools is more important (at this time, not necessarily in the future) than <strong>what</strong> i&#8217;m coding.</p>


	<p>I can only be so productive when you give me a flint rock and some leaves, but if you give me a half-gallon of napalm and a propane torch, i can work wonders :) I&#8217;m also a load happier torching the entire forest than struggling to cook dinner&#8230;</p>


	<p>Forgive me if some of my analogies don&#8217;t make sense, i have been beering appropriately&#8230; Feel free to demoralize where applicable.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>The interesting correlation between Getting Things Done and the book Flow, is that very early on in <span class="caps">GTD</span>, David Allen asks you &#8216;Can you get into your &#8220;Productive State&#8221; when required?&#8217;. He&#8217;s basically asking you if you can create this flow condition without much hassle. His method is designed to make this condition available to as a matter of course.</p>


	<p>To most programmers I know, this flow condition is something that just sometimes &#8216;happens&#8217; (and usually after hours when they&#8217;re working back late and not being distracted). These programmers stay back late just to experience this condition (I personally quit that workplace, overtime &#8216;just to get work done&#8217;, peh).</p>


	<p>Flow is more of an analysis of the condition and what makes it up, whereas <span class="caps">GTD</span> seems to be more focused on the framework of giving yourself the room to get into the condition.</p>


	<p>I agree there is a major correlation between Test Driven Development and the condition. This is the &#8216;Clear Goals and Immediate Feedback&#8217; characteristic they describe in Flow (and by the way, it&#8217;s not just programmers who have this experience; part of their study indicated that people working in factories doing repetitive work in factories could experience flow, and they did, and were very happy and satisfied people).</p>


	<p>I recommend reading both books at the same time, neither replaces the other.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time for more quick little roundups of notes and followups on things I&#8217;ve mentioned before.</p>


	<h4><a href="http://newhavenadvocate.com/gbase/Lifestyle/content.html?oid=oid:15519">Life Without a <span class="caps">PDA</span></a></h4>


	<p>This is random, but I now have written for an alternative weekly. About six months ago, a friend of mine who lives in New Haven and writes for the <a href="http://www.newhavenadvocate.com/">New Haven Advocate</a> told me they were thinking of starting a personal tech column (think of a snarkier Walt Mossberg or David Pogue), and he wanted to know if I was interested. The pay would be low of course (this is an alt. weekly), but visions of free electronics swag kept dancing in my head. Thus, I wrote a few audition columns before Christmas. The column idea was eighty-sixed, but one of my submissions apparently lived on. And it surfaced for last week&#8217;s issue as <a href="http://newhavenadvocate.com/gbase/Lifestyle/content.html?oid=oid:15519">Against Palm Pilots</a> or <em>How one man lost his religion and re-discovered note-taking on paper</em>. In which I lay out my long-running problems with the Palm and the happiness I&#8217;ve found instead with Moleskines and the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda/">Hipster <span class="caps">PDA</span></a> (<em>Merlin, they left out the credit, but know it belongs all to you.</em>) I like writing for a more general public audience, and I hope I will get to do more columns in the future.</p>


	<h4><a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/05/31/are-you-happy">Are You Happy?</a></h4>


	<p>I realize I should also have linked to the original book on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060920432/104-7362462-8543137?n=283155">Flow</a>. For those who want to read more recent discussion on the subject, <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> highlighted some good recent treatments from <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/97/art-of-work.html">FastCompany</a> and Metafilter on <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/28878">the book</a> and <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/33811">application</a>. And of course, <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a> has <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/02/09/flow/">a nice roundup of links</a> as well as a related discussion on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/05/12/zanshin-the-remaining-mind/">zanshin</a>. Scott Berkun touches on how <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay46.htm">Flow relates to sucky software</a>.   And so on.</p>


	<p>The point here is people are doing Ruby on Rails not because it comes within some whiz-bang <span class="caps">IDE </span>(it doesn&#8217;t) or it has a bunch of wizards and graphical builder dohickeys (it doesn&#8217;t) or even because it promises productivity boosts (they&#8217;re there, but as a result). Rather, they&#8217;re excited because with only a text editor and a copy of Pickaxe by your side, you can do some amazing things and get into that state. And that makes you happy. And that makes you productive, because <em>you actually want to do the work.</em></p>


	<h4><a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2006/06/01/just-go-with-the-flow">Planet Argon Rocks!</a></h4>


	<p>Wow, I was wondering about an uptick in my readership, and now I know I have <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2006/06/01/just-go-with-the-flow">Robby Russell to thank</a>! <strong>harrisj loves Planet Argon!</strong> Seriously, Robby and his brave and fearless crew are doing some of the smartest and most honest coding and writing I&#8217;ve seen, and you should definitely read Robby Russell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/">blog</a> and and book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596101503/104-7362462-8543137?n=283155">Programming Rails</a> when it comes out. I would also like to point out the excellent blogs of <a href="http://www.jvoorhis.com/">Jeremy Voorhis</a>, <a href="http://david.planetargon.us/">Dave Gibbons</a>, <a href="http://blog.jasonwatkins.net/">Jason Watkins</a> and the rest of my fellow <a href="http://inhabitants.planetargon.com/">Planet Argon inhabitants</a>.</p>


	<h4><a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/03/09/short-takes-data-mining-and-the-attention-economy">New Camera</a></h4>


	<p>One last thing. The Canon <span class="caps">S400</span> that I revived through surgery died again thanks to an accidental coat check at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (the attendents seem to not so much hang coats as fling and kick them I guess). So, after a bit of a photographic drought, I now have a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicfz7/">Panasonic Lumix <span class="caps">DMC</span>-FZ7</a>, and I love it. There is something wonderful about the feel of it in your hand, and it takes <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harrisj/155961674/">much better pictures</a> at a fraction of the price and weight of Digital SLRs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Quality Ingredients: Story, Voice, and Metaphor</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2006/06/20/quality-ingredients-story-voice-and-metaphor/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about writing lately. There&#8217;s been a practical reason &#8212; I&#8217;ve written an ebook version of <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/04/25/rubyisms-in-rails">Rubyisms on Rails</a>   that I&#8217;ll tell you more about later &#8212; but my motivations are more abstract. I&#8217;ve been reading way too many technical books lately. Many have been good, but as one afternoon browsing the bookshelves will demonstrate, most are terrible. As <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> exclaims in exasperation in the forward to the excellent book of software essays <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590595009/104-7362462-8543137?n=283155">The Best Software Writing 1</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>The software development world desperately needs better writing. If I have to read another 200-page book about some class library written by 16 <em>separate</em> people in broken <span class="caps">ESL</span>, I&#8217;m going to flip out. If I see another hardback book about object-oriented models written with dense faux-academic pretentiousness, I&#8217;m not going to shelve it any more in the Fog Creek library: it&#8217;s going right in the recycle bin. If I have to read another spirited attack on Microsoft&#8217;s buggy code by an enthusiastic nine-year-old Trekkie on Slashdot, I might just poke my eyes out with a sharpened pencil. Stop it, stop it, stop it!</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>For Spolsky, the most important ingredient missing from dull technical books is <strong>story</strong>. As he puts it, good tech writing captures your interest by creating a plausible or interesting story. The resulting text may be much more verbose &#8212; in an example, he spins out the insipid truism &#8220;a good team leader provides inspiration by setting a good example&#8221; into an involved 400 word story &#8212; but the story is what makes you want to keep reading more. Looking at some recent purchases, I can see the effectiveness in some notable recent books. In the simplest case, you can go far with a compelling example application you elaborate in each successive chapter like <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_eir/">Enterprise Integration with Ruby</a> does.
is built on the solid story of an example integrated in each chapter. It&#8217;s not necessary to have one big story, however. You can also structure your book as a sequence of independent smaller stories, as recent favorites <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/pad/index.html">Practices of an Agile Developer</a> and <a href="http://scottberkun.com/books/artofpm/">The Art of Project Management</a> did so well.</p>


	<p>On a contrasting note, <a href="http://www.slash7.com/">Amy Hoy</a> in an article disparaging the <a href="http://www.slash7.com/articles/2006/03/03/are-women-better-writers-duh">suggestion that being a woman is what solely makes her a good writer</a>, suggests another important ingredient is <del>breasts</del> <strong>voice</strong>. The way to make a technical article compelling is to make it personable. This is something that Joel hints at with his dig at &#8220;16 separate writers&#8221; and it is something certainly borne out by the selections in the book &#8212; practically every selection is a blog posting and is thus opionated, direct, and personal by their very nature &#8212; but Joel focuses more on what is being said than how it is said. Voice matters, and nobody has done as good a job asserting the importance of a personal tone than Amy has. But it&#8217;s hard for technical writers to understand. When we are first learning to write essays in elementary school, we&#8217;re taught to prize dispassionate objectivity above a personal voice. This is not to blame teachers; that makes a lot of sense when you&#8217;re teaching writing to fifth graders whose idea of an argument might run along the lines of &#8220;This book is bad because I didn&#8217;t like it,&#8221; and good writers learn eventually to balance their personal opinions and objective fact in essays. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www-tech.mit.edu/V120/N36/feespeech.36n.html">nerds usually aren&#8217;t good writers</a>, and I think too many books are written by developers too mortified to express their personalities (even if they could). But if you edit out your personality from your writing, you might as well do your readers a favor and delete the whole book. An example of books that benefit from voice are Martin Fowler&#8217;s classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672/104-7362462-8543137?n=283155">Refactoring</a> and the more recent book <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/databaseRefactoringCatalog.html">Refactoring Databases</a>.  Refactoring code is a discussion prone to tedium, but the books succeed because they sparkle with clarity and reflect the single voices of their authors.</p>


	<p>Before I continue, I should clarify a few points. Joel&#8217;s emphasis on story and Amy&#8217;s on voice are not mutually exclusive: I can explicitly emphasize that <em>something <strong>happened</strong> to me</em> or <em>something happened to <strong>me</strong></em>, but both voice and story exist in any compelling technical narrative. The second point is you can only do so much.
There will be always be some dullness that&#8217;s unavoidable in technical literature. It&#8217;s simply impossible to make some content interesting (ever read a truly fun <a href="http://linux.ctyme.com/">man page</a> ever?), and if you tried to make it fun, you&#8217;ll actually annoy your readers (&#8220;Hey kids! Let&#8217;s sing the arguments to <span class="caps">GCC</span> as a song!&#8221;). But a technical book is more than a listing of compiler options or valid function parameter or working code samples. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron">introns in <span class="caps">DNA</span></a>, the bulk of any technical work is interstitial material that holds the boring stuff together. And that is where your writing should shine.</p>


	<p>Which brings me to my point. I want to draw attention to another important ingredient that complements those two yet gets short shrift: <strong>metaphor</strong>. To see what I mean by metaphor in action, look at my <span class="caps">DNA</span> example from the previous paragraph (<em>I know, technically it&#8217;s a simile</em>). Assuming you knew what an intron is &#8212; in a book I obviously would explain it more explicitly than a blog post &#8212; that aside conjures up a rich web of allusion that clarifies the emphasis of the point (that the bulk of your book might not be technically explicit and yet still be meaningful for the whole). The beauty of metaphors is they evoke all sorts of mental associations in your readers that act like scaffolding (<em>a metaphor</em>) that helps your readers learn material by building upon concepts they&#8217;re innately familiar with. And they come with an expressive power that allow you to express complicated ideas succinctly through allusion (ie, instead of having to spell out what scaffolding is used for like I just did, you can just describe it as scaffolding and leave the reader&#8217;s brain to fill in the rest).</p>


	<p>Metaphors are truly useful things, and since this is my soapbox (<em>another metaphor!</em>), I&#8217;ll declare that metaphors are woefully under-utilized in technical writing. I think one reason for this is technical writers are discouraged from metaphor to be more <em>universal</em> &#8212; if I make a metaphor specific to New York City, it might fall flat to a reader in Germany or India; not only would I have to explain my technical content, I&#8217;d have to explain my metaphor! You can avoid regionalism pretty easily though, so I think the biggest stumbling block is geeks themselves. Mainly, that same literal geek writer that sticks to the facts and recoils in horror from anything that smacks of <em>poetry</em>.</p>


	<p>This is a dearth made more unfortunate because good metaphors reinforce both story and voice. If you are boring like me and have no personal experiences to relate, you can fabricate your narrative on the back of a metaphor instead. And your use of metaphor breaks your text out of the dry and technical and provides a place for your unique personal voice to be expressed.
To give an example of this in action, I recently had to explain the virtue of iterators in Ruby for the ebook on Rubyisms. I could describe how they work technically easy enough, but I felt that a metaphor was the best way to explain why iterators make more sense (and given the number of programmers still iterating through array elements in Java, this is something most programmers still don&#8217;t understand). So I brought out an unlikely metaphor to anchor why iterators are better: traveling crosscountry on local roads vs. highways.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Iâ€™ve described this book as a drive down local roads, but now itâ€™s time to take to the highways. Highways are fascinating concepts. Although they seem like an inevitable part of the driving infrastructure, highways are actually quite new in the history of roads. As recently as the early 1900s for instance, a drive across the country was essentially the same as driving across town, navigating a dense network of local roads that would get you there eventually but not efficiently. Routes were not clearly demarcated, and road maps as we know them didnâ€™t exist. Each driver would have to figure out their own routes, a challenge when navigation comprised only instructions like â€œtake right at third fork in the roadâ€? or â€œturn left at the willow tree.â€? Of course, getting lost was inevitable. And accidents and mishaps were all too common on neglected backcountry roads. This might seem a cartoonish depiction of long-distance driving, but itâ€™s thatâ€™s largely a reflection on just how fast, safe, predictable, and even boring intercity travel has become due to highways. And thatâ€™s because the highway changed the very nature of long-distance trips.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Highways are built not from asphalt and cement, but from limitations. Instead of connecting to every road, a highway runs largely isolated from local roads with only a scant selection of exits where new traffic can enter and leave. Highways never actually intersect directly with other roads except by exits and ramps, meaning traffic control mechanisms like rotaries and stop lights arenâ€™t needed and traffic can move faster. This also has the additional effect of discouraging local traffic from taking the road, leaving the road for the serious long-haul motorists. Most significantly of all, highways simplify navigation. Rather than picking a route over local roads, the highway is a road that limits your route. To enter a highways is to largely surrender navigational choices: there are no turns or forks in the road to decide among; backtracking and U-turns are forbidden; your only option is to drive forward until you reach your exit. You can drive faster because you have less to decide, and you can navigate easier because you have less to consider. And so a trip from New York to Chicago used to be an impossible slog of endless directions. Now, itâ€™s a largely mundane trip of only 3 highway segments (although admittedly, you stay on I-80 for an astonishing 750 miles of the way).</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>I then go on to explain that running through array elements by incrementing an integer index is a lot like driving cross country on local roads, prone to complexity, mishap and error. From there, an Iterator is a lot like a highway, less worrying about navigation, more involvement with the act of driving. I&#8217;m not posting this example to toot my horn in any way (and not as a teaser for the book, although it works that way). It&#8217;s just a nice recent case where I pulled a metaphor out of my writer&#8217;s toolbox.
From there, I was able to spin out the explicit technical reasons why it&#8217;s better to use iterators, but I feel I can succeed because the reader is able to relate to the scaffolding of highway driving, a metaphor well understood by much of my audience (sorry to readers in deepest Papua-New Guinea). I think you&#8217;ll agree it&#8217;s a lot more vivid to think of access violations as wrong turns and fencepost errors as navigational errors. You can&#8217;t help but learn the material because you already know it in some sense. Metaphors aren&#8217;t poetic navel-gazing, they&#8217;re a necessary ingredient to the book. So, mix them in sometime. I think you&#8217;ll like the taste.</p>


	<p><strong>Update:</strong> The book is coming out soon. I&#8217;ll post details when I know. Watch for an announcement soon. I promise!</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>I don&#8217;t think reading a blog post should take me more than 5 minutes.</p>


	<p>I did see something about breasts that I didn&#8217;t quite understand.</p>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s funny. I majored in creative writing in college. This wasn&#8217;t too many years ago. Nestled myself in the spoken word community of San Francisco. Writing like crazy&#8212;crazy writing too.</p>


	<p>Anyway. Not much of that anymore. Instead, programming. After years of Perl, Ruby was this new beacon of light. It was like this Commodore 64 game I used to play as a kid&#8212;Story Machine. Ruby reminded me of that game and the joy I had in making stories come true on the computer.</p>


	<p>Whyâ€™s (poignant) guide to ruby was my first exposure to the language and it was perfect. Engaging. I wished I had it in hardcopy though.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;d love to see programming books, especially on more complex topics, become more literary.</p>


	<p>I personally would have a ball writing such a programming book. I can imagine something like Richard Brautigan&#8217;s In Watermelon Sugar or Trout Fishing in America intermingling with Programming Ruby. Instead of developing a jukebox you&#8217;d be building rivers and putting the dead in glowing boxes under the water. And creating Tiger objects that have great singing voices, process arithmetic&#8230;</p>


	<p>That&#8217;d be cool.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Some of my favorite parts of my book were the crappy jokes / puns I made. I don&#8217;t know if everyone else likes them, but they help give the book a little personality, something I agree is important to portray in technical books that can otherwise get quite monotonous.</p>


	<p>On a side note on highways, the town I grew up in, Horseheads, New York, has a major highway (route 17, the future I-90 or something like that) that runs through the middle of it, but in it&#8217;s infinite wisdom also has three traffic lights right on the highway that our bound to catch you if you&#8217;re traveling through. Apprarently Papua-New Guinea isn&#8217;t the only backwards place where people don&#8217;t understand the purpose of highways. :-)</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Things I Figured Out</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2006/07/03/things-i-figured-out-technical-edition/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And now for something different (and <em>shorter</em>, for those recovering from the length of the last post). Insanely talented Internet prankster <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/">Rob Cockburn</a> recently posted a short and sweet article <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/lessons/figured/figured.shtml">Things I Figured Out</a>, where he listed a bunch of interesting and slightly stupid revelations he&#8217;s had over the years. This has been followed by 15 pages of <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/lessons/figured/figured01.shtml">reader comments</a> chronicling their own  brilliant insights and forehead-slapping moments.</p>


	<p>I think this is a brilliant idea for an article, and I&#8217;ve certainly had my moments of utter brilliance and sheer stupidity (even this blog probably has examples of both). So, I&#8217;m going to post a few of the things I&#8217;ve figured out on my own or, failing that, learned the hard way. But since this is a technical blog only, there will be no personal idiocy. Just technical things I now know better about now</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>XML is Not For Everything</strong> Great for long data files, lousy for configuration files, downright terrible for love notes. It&#8217;s not one-size-fits-all.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>XML Is a Minute to Learn, a Lifetime to Master</strong> It&#8217;s easy to gloss over some of <span class="caps">XML</span>&#8217;s subtleties when you begin, but they&#8217;ll get you later if you aren&#8217;t careful. Sadly, very few resources articulate some of the things that&#8217;ll get you, but maybe there&#8217;s a future blog post about that.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Somebody&#8217;s Done It Better Already</strong> I&#8217;m being glib here, but one of the joys of Open Source is that if you need a generic component, it&#8217;s best to look for someone who&#8217;s created it already. For instance, if you need a logger, you could write one on your own, but there are excellent libraries out there and your time is better spent writing stuff you can sell.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>HTTP Blows Away Raw Sockets</strong> Unless you absolutely, positively have no choice, there is no reason you should use raw sockets instead of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> protocol for remote services. Sure, it might be harder to set up in the short run, but it&#8217;s so much easier to debug and maintain in the long run this is a no-brainer. Especially since small, light, and fast <span class="caps">HTTP</span> parsing libraries are available for all.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Often Too Much Is Worse Than Too Little</strong> Or as Donald Knuth put it, &#8220;Premature optimization is the root of all evil.&#8221; I&#8217;ve been stung so many times by trying to be clever, I&#8217;ve finally realized I should see if it&#8217;s slow before I try to fix what ain&#8217;t broke.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Stored Procedures Are Evil</strong> DBAs swear by them because they&#8217;re supposed to control access and speed up performance. In reality, they move application logic out of your program into an awkward language (SQL) that will usually fall out of sync with your application and aren&#8217;t kept consistently in sourcesafe or migrations. Worse still, they&#8217;re the trenches for warfare between developers and operations.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Developers Black-Box Way Too Much</strong> It&#8217;s too easy to leave this with a clichÃ© admonition to &#8220;think outside the box,&#8221; but it&#8217;s sadly true. As developers, we&#8217;re taught early the useful technique of abstracting away complexity within black boxes. This is useful for that third-party <span class="caps">API</span> or calling operating systems, but it&#8217;s very easy to fall into that trap in your job (&#8220;we&#8217;ve <em>always</em> done it this way&#8221;) or your life (&#8220;I&#8217;ll just wait for career advancement to come to me&#8221;).</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Physical Contact Matters</strong> The Internet still hasn&#8217;t annihilated geography yet. And personal, physical presence still matters. Meeting people is so much better than emailing them. Which I guess is just a roundabout way of saying, yet again, I should&#8217;ve gone to <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/">Railsconf</a>. Sorry!</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>You&#8217;re Going to Screw Up The First Time. Just Accept It.</strong> It&#8217;s so easy to fall into the fear of not getting it right the first time, you never get started. Get over it. Accept you&#8217;re going to make mistakes the first time around and you&#8217;ll fix it later and do the best you can. And if you can, write unit tests to make it easier to clean it up when you start.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>Things Break Slowly, Rarely All at Once</strong> It&#8217;s rare you can pinpoint a single decision or piece of code where everything catastrophically failed. Instead, the road to failure and mediocrity is a gradual and painful process, of many small failures along the way. It&#8217;s hard to resist the downwards momentum, because it always seems feasible to reverse. I would like to see more project management texts that tell you how to stop digging that hole.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>If You Can&#8217;t Explain It, You Shouldn&#8217;t Do It.</strong> Sometimes I think half of IT operates by overwhelming your natural instincts and confusion with so much jargon, your brain just gives up. It&#8217;s a mysticism of sorts, but the wakeup to reality again is painful. My rule of thumb is if I can&#8217;t explain it in plain English using metaphors, and optionally table utensils, then it&#8217;s not worth doing. Because it most certainly will not be maintainable.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Okay, that&#8217;s all I have so far. But I&#8217;m sure the realizations will keep coming. Happy 4th of July everybody!</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>I got an surprising 25/30 (and 2 of the bonus questions).</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/07/the-big-here">Jason Kottke gave it a shot</a></p>


	<p><strong>Questions I Got Right</strong></p>


	<p><em>1) Point north.</em> A little bit harder when you work downtown below the grid plan, but as Kottke also observed the street grid of Manhattan is a useful guide, albeit one pointing about 30 degrees east of North (otherwise, <a href="http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/cityofstars.html">Manhattanhenge</a> would happen on the equinox)</p>


	<p><em>2) What time is sunset today?</em> Owning a dog leaves me with a good approximate idea of the sunset each day, although I can not tell you it exactly. But I&#8217;m giving me this one anyway.</p>


	<p><em>3) Trace the water you drink from rainfall to your tap.</em> There are several reservoirs in Westchester and Rockland county that bring water into Manhattan by way of the Croton Reservoir. Currently, New York has 2 water tunnels serving it, but neither can be taken offline for repairs. Water Tunnel #3 is <a href="http://www.ita-aites.org/cms/319.html">still under construction</a> (started in 1970, but not expected to be completed until 2020).</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re a big fan of infrastructure and urban exploration, Jessica Solis&#8217; &#8220;New York Underground&#8221; is an rollicking collection of stories and photographs from various unauthorized excursions around the city. The book starts off with a look at the water structure including a stretch of rafting down Tunnel #1 from Croton to Harlem.</p>


	<p><em>4) When you flush, where do the solids go? What happens to the waste water?</em> This is not a topic for the squeamish, but I know it anyway. Thanks to the excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316738263">Garbageland: On The Secret Trail of Trash</a> by Elizabeth Royte, I know my solids and waste water go to a treatment plant at Owl Point north of Bay Ridge in Brooklyn. There they are treated and the cleaned water is eventually released into the bay. Meanwhile, the city is trying to find a good market for fertilizer created from the solid waste (it&#8217;s excellent for mushrooms apparently), but the human origins of it make it a hard sell. Aren&#8217;t you glad you know that now?</p>


	<p><em>5) How many feet above sea level are you?</em> My home is about 14 meters above sea level. Thank you Internet for the <a href="http://flood.firetree.net/">flood map</a>!</p>


	<p><em>7) How far do you have to travel before you reach a different watershed? Can you draw the boundaries of yours?</em> I could travel down to the Delaware river or into Connecticut to find the next one.</p>


	<p><em>8) Is the soil under your feet, more clay, sand, rock or silt?</em> It varies. In Manhattan a lot of the soil is rock, specifically schist (a fun word to say), which is why we have skyscrapers (except where the bedrock level dips under Greenwich Village). However, a large part of Brooklyn and Manhattan&#8217;s waterfront is actually landfill, which I guess would count as a mix of clay, rock, and silt.</p>


	<p><em>9) Before your tribe lived here, what did the previous inhabitants eat and how did they sustain themselves?</em> There have been a lot of tribes through Manhattan in some sense. Not counting <a href="http://www.ellisisland.org/default.asp">the waves of migration</a> and <a href="http://www.tenement.org/">gentrification before mine</a>, the island even changed nations. Before the British took over, New York was New Amsterdam, and Russell Shorto&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385503490/104-7362462-8543137?n=283155">The Island at the Center of the World</a> is a nice book to read if you&#8217;re fascinated. Of course though, the original inhabitants were not the Dutch, but the Native Americans, and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140004006X/">1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus</a>  is an excellent summary of new research about America before the Europeans.</p>

	<p><img src="http://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/0316738263.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>So what tribe was here when the Dutch arrived? Various tribes of the <a href="http://www.delawaretribeofindians.nsn.us/">Lenape</a> were here and greeted English, Dutch, and Swedish explorers when they sailed up the coast. From accounts of people like Henry Hudson (who visited in 1609; New Yorkers, get ready for the massive 400th anniversary events), we know they farmed corn and beans, ate wild game, and especially enjoyed the rich food selections from the fertile New York Estuary.</p>

	<p>Specifically, they consumed a lot of oysters, as Mark Kurlansky&#8217;s latest book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345476387">The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell</a> charmingly relates. It may seem a bit hard to discern today amidst the concrete and the skyscrapers and the chemical plants of New Jersey, but New York city has an amazing natural harbor, with three rivers and the sea forming a rich estuary for marshlands. This was excellent for shipping, and New York today is as direct result of its early maritime advantages. But it was really excellent for oysters.</p>


	<p>10) Name five native edible plants in your neighborhood and the season(s) they are available. [Recommendations]</p>


	<p><em>11) From what direction do storms generally come?</em> Storms usually come from the West.</p>


	<p><em>12) Where does your garbage go?</em></p>


	<p><em>13) How many people live in your watershed?</em></p>


	<p><em>14) Who uses the paper/plastic you recycle from your neighborhood?</em></p>


	<p><em>15) Point to where the sun sets on the equinox. How about sunrise on the summer solstice?</em></p>


	<p><em>16) Where is the nearest earthquake fault? When did it last move?</em></p>


	<p>18) Which (if any) geological features in your watershed are, or were, especially respected by your community, or considered sacred, now or in the past? [Recommendations]</p>


	<p><em>20) Name five birds that live here. Which are migratory and which stay put?</em></p>


	<p>Pigeons, squabs, rock doves, rats with wings, pigeons. Okay, I&#8217;m kidding there. Most of the city only has what are known as</p>


	<p><em>22) Where does the pollution in your air come from?</em></p>


	<p><em>23) If you live near the ocean, when is high tide today?</em></p>


	<p><em>24) What primary geological processes or events shaped the land here?</em></p>


	<p><em>25) Name three wild species that were not found here 500 years ago. Name one exotic species that has appeared in the last 5 years.</em></p>


	<p>Starling, Zebra Mussels, Norwegian Black Rat.</p>


	<p>Asian Longhorned Beetle</p>


	<p><em>27) Where does your electric power come from and how is it generated?</em></p>


	<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594200718">The Works: Anatomy of a City</a> by Kate Ascher</p>


	<p><em>28) After the rain runs off your roof, where does it go?</em></p>


	<p><em>29) Where is the nearest wilderness? When was the last time a fire burned through it?</em></p>


	<p><em>30) How many days till the moon is full?</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight years. That&#8217;s how long I have worked at Alacra, starting fresh
out of school in the heady days of the first web boom. Eight years is
an astounding length of time to most programmers, conditioned to a
revolving door approach to employment, and it is a testament to what
an interesting and nurturing place Alacra is that I&#8217;ve been here this
long. Furthermore, I&#8217;m hardly an anomaly among the developers, most of
whom have been here well over five years too. It&#8217;s a place where
people like to stay, and it feels more like a family than an office
sometimes. But I am now leaving. Alacra&#8217;s been my only post-college
job, and it&#8217;s simply time for me to try something new.</p>


	<p>Next week, I will start working at <a href="http://www.nytdigital.com/">New York Times
Digital</a>. Yes, that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York
Times</a> that is delivered to about 1.5 million readers
in dead tree form. That number might seem impressive in itself, but
<strong>50 times that number</strong> of users read the online web version, meaning I
will be working on apparently <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2006/05/the_leading_glo.html">the most popular online news site in the
world</a>. Yow. No
pressure there. Seriously though, I am looking forward to the
challenges and I hope to learn a lot of new skills on the job. The <a href="http://newyorktimesbuilding.com/">new office building</a>
will also be pretty sweet when it opens.</p>


	<p>Still, the change is weird. It&#8217;s definitely been a strange two weeks
in this liminal zone, and I am filled with conflicting emotions. I am
sad about leaving all my colleagues at Alacra, but enthusiastic about the
opportunities ahead. It&#8217;s an exciting time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Rubyisms in Rails Redux</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2006/08/02/rubyisms-in-rails-redux/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby "><span class="constant">self</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">promote!</span></code></pre></div>

	<p>I am pleased to announce that the <a href="http://www.informit.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0321474074&#38;rl=1">digital shortcut <span class="caps">PDF</span> version</a> (to purchase, you have to go to the <a href="http://www.informit.com/shortcuts">Digital Shortcuts page</a> or you can buy it from <a href="http://safari.awprofessional.com/0321474074">Safari</a> Sorry!) of my <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/04/25/rubyisms-in-rails">Rubyisms in Rails</a> presentation is finally available for purchase. At 54 pages in length for the low price of $9.99, I guarantee you&#8217;ll glean at least 18.5 cents of insight from each page (disclaimer: that&#8217;s a mean instructional value; although gorgeous, the title page is not particularly educational in itself).</p>


	<p>In addition, the book is also now available in <a href="http://safari.awprofessional.com/">Safari Books Online</a>, and possibly Amazon or other retailers as well. Also, be sure to check out the list of <a href="http://www.informit.com/shortcuts">other upcoming Ruby titles</a>.</p>


	<p>So, what&#8217;s in it? If you&#8217;ve read the original presentation, you already have a sense of the scope of material I am covering here, but the shortcut allows me to focus on the material in greater depth. The result is a richer and more thorough examination of the examples presented in the original slides. If you are an intermediate to advanced Rails hacker, you probably know all this stuff already. But if you are a newcomer to Ruby through Rails, or you still find yourself still stuck coding <span class="caps">PHP</span> or Java-like Ruby, this ebook might help to align your thinking to the Ruby way.</p>


	<p>Will I write another ebook? I&#8217;d say yes, but I&#8217;ll have to think up another interesting topic. But if you are ever thinking of creating a technical book, I&#8217;d recommend starting in a smaller dose like this first. As I discovered, even 54 pages can be a lot of work, and it&#8217;s better to test out your time commitments and abilities with something small before you start pitching large references. But that&#8217;s a topic for another blog posting. Make me happy: <a href="http://www.informit.com/shortcuts">Buy the ebook</a> or <a href="http://safari.awprofessional.com/0321474074">read it on Safari</a> and give me your feedback. Thanks!</p>


	<h4>Update</h4>


	<p>Fixed purchase link to be go to Shortcuts page (where you can add to cart).</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I loved the book in presentation form enough to purchase a copy of the new version.  I have to say one thing though, please don&#8217;t support companies that use this horrible <span class="caps">DRM</span> software again.  I&#8217;m a mac user and this just kills us (plus having a page limit on how many pages to print within a month is absurd).  Take a queue from the Prag. Prog. guys and release in name-stamped PDFs and have a little faith in your readers.  Other than that I&#8217;m glad to see another excellent addition to the ruby library.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Geoff, thanks for the input. I must admit I wasn&#8217;t really aware of <span class="caps">PDF DRM </span>(I&#8217;ve tended to buy all my books in physical form), so I will plead in my defense that the problems were caused by ignorance here rather than malice. I have nothing but the highest faith in my readers. I am sorry to hear it though, and I&#8217;ll see what I can do with my publisher.</p>


	<p>Also, this book is now available in Safari too if that helps. Thank you.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I recently read the book (on Safari), and just wanted to say what a great book it is! I&#8217;ve been tinkering with Rails for awhile now, but you hit the nail on the head with the topics you covered: The distinction between &#8220;Duck Typing&#8221; and strongly-typed languages, Symbols, Blocks and a look at the guts of Rails in the <span class="caps">DSL</span> section (I&#8217;m not giving too much away, am I?) were just what I needed. Suddenly, a lot of things make sense.</p>


	<p>Top notch.</p>

  <title>Rubyisms In Rails DRM Woes?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry for the silence. I was on vacation in Alaska recently, so I&#8217;ve not really been in the blogging mood. But here is a short note and plea for understanding.</p>


	<p>Early reviews (okay, <em>review</em> as I&#8217;ve only had one; let me know if you&#8217;ve written one or want to do a review) of the ebook have been <a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/suggestedreading/gr/rubyisms_rails.htm">encouragingly favorable</a>, but the biggest complaints I&#8217;ve gotten so far have been about the <span class="caps">DRM</span>. I have spoken to my publisher and she&#8217;s informed me this was a mistake that was corrected after the first day, and if you&#8217;ve been stung with a <span class="caps">DRM</span>-afflicted version, we will provide you with a <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free replacement. Furthermore, <strong>no books in the Ruby Shortcut series will have <span class="caps">DRM</span>.</strong></p>


	<p>The best way to do this would be to <a href="mailto:harrisj@schizopolis.net?subject=Rubyisms DRM Victim Seeks Replacement">mail me directly</a> and I will pass along your email address to my publisher to send you a replacement copy. My email address is <strong>harrisj</strong> @ <strong>schizopolis.net</strong>. It&#8217;s probably easier to just click that mailto link above though.</p>


	<p>Sorry for the problems. This is a new direction for them and me, and I guess we still had a few kinks to work out. Thanks for your patience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Or You Can Cheat</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, long time no blog. Work and home life have just sucked all the mental energy out of me lately. For those of you who still have kept me in your feedrolls or click here from time to time, I have a new set of slides presented for your personal enjoyment.</p>


	<p>Last week&#8212;transfixed by the horror of an empty slate of speakers&#8212;I decided it was time to give another talk to the <span class="caps">NYC</span>.rb and so I spent a few days throwing together a presentation I titled <em>Or You Can Cheat</em>. It&#8217;s all about how you can write C extensions for Ruby and also how this something you shouldn&#8217;t undertake lightly. I have a very <em>interesting</em> approach to presentations: when I want to learn more about a subject, I throw together a presentation on it. I think the combination of casual interest and the abject fear of humiliation in front of my peers is a great personal motivational tool. This talk continues that trend, and while I can not claim to be a definitive expert on C extensions for Ruby, I certainly know a lot more about the subject now and I think you will too.</p>


	<p>If you are interested, you can download the talk here</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/files/rubyextend.pdf">Or You Can Cheat</a>  (600K <span class="caps">PDF</span>)</p>


	<p>This is a bit more silly and off-the-cuff than <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/04/25/rubyisms-in-rails">Rubyisms in Rails</a>, and I really enjoyed it. There are a few references I should clarify though. First, there is the matter of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arepa">arepas</a>. The arepa is <strong>the</strong> official food of <a href="http://www.nycruby.org/">NYC.rb</a> and it is a rite of passage here to take visiting Ruby eminences to our official supplier, the <a href="http://www.caracasarepabar.com/">Caracas Arepa Bar</a>. Asides from being addictively tasty, arepas serve as a perfect metaphor for Ruby extensions, in that they wrap the tasty ingredients inside a pragmatic corn flour shell. They really are that tasty. Yes, I also suppose I was a bit harsh calling Joel Spolsky a troll, but I had no other term to <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/12.html">describe his wild extrapolation</a> that current Ruby interpreter performance augurs that Ruby will always be slow, that Rails is a horrible web development framework, and how you should shackle your entire development environment around the slowest part. But he is right that Ruby currently is slow for <em>some uses</em>, and C exensions are a potent way to resolve those edge cases without throwing in the towel.</p>


	<p>And yet, I hope you&#8217;re not dropping everything to write them.</p>


	<p>Why the lukewarm recommendation? Well, I think Ruby performance has become an all-purpose scapegoat these days. In some cases, this is deserved (we need <span class="caps">YARV</span>. Now.), but it&#8217;s all too easy to blame Ruby when the real problem is your web server, your database, or some stupid algorithm you wrote that&#8217;s wildly inefficient. Rule all that out first before you dive into C extensions for Ruby. Because C is dangerous, C is tricky, and C is just plain <strong>no fun.</strong> C extensions can be like eating an arepa filled with broken glass if you aren&#8217;t careful. But they also are a useful tool for performance and especially for wrapping existing libraries and legacy code.</p>


	<p>Which gets me wondering if there are any cool killer apps for C extensions and Ruby. Are there some cool open-source libraries that would be nice with Ruby bindings? How cool would could a combination of <a href="http://www.rufy.com/starfish/doc/">Starfish</a> and <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/RubyInline/">RubyInline</a> really be? Would we need to use C extensions to create rbsh, a Ruby shell? What other fun things could you do if you had nice Ruby tongs to keep that nasty C code at bay? Let me know if you have any awesome ideas and if you enjoyed these slides. And in return, I&#8217;ll try to see if I can actually blog again one of these days. Thanks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>So, if you&#8217;ve been checking on my blog lately, you might have noticed I&#8217;ve been rather lame about blogging lately (as opposed to before when I was <em>somewhat</em> lame). Sorry about that, I can promise I&#8217;ll try to change, but I have a lot of stuff going on in my life that doesn&#8217;t involve sitting in front of a computer. Mainly, this:</p>


	<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m going to be a father for the first time (expected due date: May 9th). Now that we&#8217;ve passed beyond the first trimester superstitiousness and jitters, I want to tell the whole world. Thanks for reading, and hopefully I&#8217;ll write something else for you one of these days.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here in New York, it&#8217;s routine for people you&#8217;ve just met to ask you what you do for a living (we inquire about rent when we get to know each other better, about 10 minutes later). As interesting as it was at <a href="http://www.alacra.com">Alacra</a>, most people&#8217;s eyes would start to glaze over when I summarized the various minutiae of reselling financial information online (I eventually learned to describe it through the metaphor of a grocery store). But everybody knows about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a>, and I can almost visualize the cascade of associative thoughts&#8212;complete with press passes tucked in fedoras, people shouting at each other in a news room, and the obligatory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_Newspaper">spinning newspaper transition</a>. This then leads right into the next question: that&#8217;s the newspaper, but what do you do at <a href="http://www.nytdigital.com/">Times Digital</a> that&#8217;s so different and special? Not much for the moment, and that&#8217;s a problem.</p>


	<p>The lion&#8217;s share of traffic to the New York Times Digital goes to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">www.nytimes.com</a>, which is largely just a reformatting of the printed paper for a web audience. Sure there are some additional applications specific only to the website (eg, you can <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/showtimes.html?title=&#38;zip=11231&#38;x=0&#38;y=0">search through movie reviews</a> and we now have <a href="http://video.on.nytimes.com/">videos</a>), but you could easily miss them, since the focus on presenting a cohesive look that mirrors the printed product all but guarantees that anything truly exclusive to the website will never be allowed to stand out. Indeed, one might get the sense that the management of the Times thinks of the Web as merely another printing format, rather than a completely different <strong>medium</strong> in its own right. Despite the fact that online readership obliterates the print subscribers these days, I would honestly be surprised if any newspaper&#8217;s editorial board contained a member who only read the paper online and &#8220;understands&#8221; the web. Furthermore, even &#8220;understanding&#8221; the Web does not entail grokking how savvy readers browse the paper online&#8212;how many newspaper editors know what a tabbed browser is for instance? or why single column is preferable to users with scroll wheels on their mice? My guess is not many. These sort of blind spots are not much of a big deal to those who want to just maintain the status quo in a new marketplace (and how mostly see the online paper as merely a convenience for people on the go), but I think there are so many unique web-only opportunities being missed out that newspapers need to grasp. And I&#8217;m going to write the next few blog posts on some ways in which newspapers might uniquely evolve online. I think the problem is not so much the people, but the cultural mindset needs to evolve a new notion of what newspapers are and how the public interacts with them. In the next few posts I will explore some ways in which the notion of newspapers might change online and how that might affect the news of tomorrrow.</p>


	<p>But first, a few disclaimers. I&#8217;m not singling out my employer only for ridicule. Many of the problems the Times faces in the Internet age (declining readership and a demographic that&#8217;s skewing older) are striking the industry as a whole. Also, unlike some smaller regional papers, the Times has been working hard to position itself as a global news brand both in print and online, which could make all the difference between success and failure in any new web ventures. And the paper side of the operations here does at least recognize that <em>something</em> must be done to reverse the slide in readership and profitability and integrate the web and newspaper operations more tightly (although they don&#8217;t quite know what that might be). But the New York Times does share much of the mindset current to the newspaper industry, and I do work here, so it&#8217;s too easy for me to single them out for examples indicative of newspapers as a whole.</p>


	<p>Also, I am not a media analyst or expert in how the newspaper business works. I do not have a journalism background and I do not even have a lot of experience working in a newspaper environment. I have never visited a newsroom and even navigating the old building&#8217;s corridors to visit the credit union or get a photo ID left me as bewildered and confused as a tired old man. It&#8217;s possible I&#8217;ll gloss over something momentous or overstate something glib. But I do think I understand the Web and how people use it and I will treat the idea with <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2006-11-28-newspapers-future_x.htm">more seriousness and depth than the usual buzzwords</a> when geeks try to reinvent the newspaper business. Hopefully it&#8217;ll be good, but as always let me know how you feel in the comments.</p>


	<p>And finally, I do believe there is a place for newspapers in the Web world and I am working here at the Times mainly because I am interested in being a part of developing new refinements of a business model that&#8217;s been unchanged for hundreds of years</p>


	<p>That said, on with the show! Newspapers online are rather limited, what are the ways they can change and embrace the web? I will be following up with four further posts organized into distinct but overlapping themes:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/12/13/advertising-the-future-newspaper">Advertising</a></li>
		<li>Distribution</li>
		<li>Disintermediation</li>
		<li>Diversity</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Notice how I started the latter three with &#8216;D&#8217; to be extra clever. Those will link to the further posts when they are published, but stay tuned and watch this space.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Advertising The Future Newspaper</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>And now for the second post in this minor series <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/11/29/all-the-news-thats-fit-to-serve">All The News Fit To Serve</a> wherein the blogger attempts to parlay a passing knowledge of the newspaper business into an exploration of how newspapers might change in the Web age. As it should go without saying, these are my opinions, and do not reflect any thinking at my employer or any actual strategy being taken there. Just needed to clear that up. That said, on with the show! This post&#8217;s theme: advertising, or how &#8220;old media&#8221; is not so much different than new media when it comes to bringing home the bacon.</em></p>


	<p>Analyzing the newspaper business today is a study in contrasts. On the one hand, print circulation continues to decline and the recent drop suggested a more extreme decline may be in the future. Net wisdom decries newspapers as <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200612/hirschorn-newspapers">ailing dinosaurs doomed to extinction by 2014</a>.
On the other hand, papers still enjoy healthy profit margins and <a href="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3885">often monopoly status in local markets</a> that gives them an advantage in covering a local area unmatched by anyone. Still, newspapers have seen some <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,71904-0.html?tw=rss.index">unsettling drops in readership</a> and the decline in classifieds might be a troubling portent. On the other hand, newspapers are <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/060403ta_talk_surowiecki">far from finsished</a> and the warning signs have actually helped some papers to retrench and repair wasteful processes. In terms of readership, ewspapers still enjoy esteemed and privileged positions in their local markets that are still worth a lot, but Wall Street is alarmed whenever at the anemic growth or even retreat many papers are suffering. Putting it more simply:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>The glass is half full</li>
		<li>But the water level is dropping at an accelerating rate</li>
	</ol>


	<p>And now every paper is trying to figure out how to refill the glass. But why is declining readership such a concern for newspapers? It helps to understand how the business operates.</p>


	<p>You might assume that papers are supported largely by subscription fees and the decline in print readership is troubling because of decline in that revenue. But for many papers, subscriptions only offset delivery and printing costs; indeed, it is possible for some small urban papers to even make a business giving away their product for free! Rather, subscriptions have the unusual property in that they are meaningless as money, but essential as a quantity. Because the real value of circulation is to set the advertising rates.</p>


	<p>Like many Web sites, the dominant driver of revenue for newspapers is advertising. Of course, there are sometimes a few other minor revenue streams (licensing, royalties, books), but advertising is such a dominant revenue source that you can directly gauge the health of a paper by the advertising rates it can charge. And since the value of an advertising in a paper is largely determined by the size of the audience it reaches, advertising rates (and advertising profits) are directly influenced by the circulation of the paper. Advertising has been exceedingly good for newspapers &#8211; the total ad market for papers is estimated at $45 billion &#8211; but the writing is on the wall. Classifieds (another form of advertising) have already precipitously declined, and it&#8217;s only a matter of time before commercial advertisers follow suit. The party is over; this is why the papers are getting scared.</p>


	<p>There is some good news on the horizon though. Internet readership of papers has been climbing steadily and ad rates are expected to continue increasing at a phenomenal rate &#8211; next year, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/technology/05adco.html?_r=2&#38;adxnnl=1&#38;oref=slogin&#38;adxnnlx=1165553774-qfiFUK3I9+Uy0NLEj8LI8w">internet advertising is expected to increase by 29% while traditional media advertising will increase only an anemic 1-2%</a> &#8211; and some papers like the New York Times have built online web sites that reach a global audience and <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2006/05/the_leading_glo.html">dwarf the readership of their printed versions</a>. A lot of geeks read these trends and argue that papers should save themselves today by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2006-11-28-newspapers-future_x.htm">discarding the printed product and surviving off websites only</a>, but such a move would only be suicide for any paper foolish enough to try it today.</p>


	<p>The catch is for all its promise, Internet advertising is nowhere near the profitability of print advertising &#8211; optimistic estimates suggest <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/technology/05adco.html?_r=1&#38;oref=slogin">it might be there in 10 years</a>. This gap is simply stunning to casual pundits like me who think the Web is a ready equivalent to anything in traditional media. Why is this disparity so great? I think it has to do with a few different factors. One possibility is that Internet advertising is not attractive enough to traditional print advertisers yet, perhaps because of its perceived limitations (you just can&#8217;t buy a flashy three-page spread in the first few pages of the Magazine online). In addition,
unlike print advertising, no single entity has a monopoly in a local ad market on the Internet. Which belies another difference between the two ad markets: the print version is local, the web version is global. I think it will take a while for some advertisers to want to reach the latter.</p>


	<p>All is not bad for for Web advertising however. As stated before, web ads are able to reach sheer numbers of people inconceivable for any print publication today and at all times of the day and night, so some profits might be made in volume. Newspapers could also conceivably farm out web advertising to outside sources too who might have a better chance selling to Internet-savvy advertisers (<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_50/b3963130.htm">Google is certainly hoping for this</a>). The main advantage of online advertising in the long run will prove to be demographics however, and how intelligently newspapers are able to target them. The audience for a print ad can only be considered as an aggregate average, since the same ad goes to every subscriber, be they rich or poor, urban or suburban, dog owners and/or video game players and/or coffee drinkers. But the beauty of Internet advertising is that you can target the ads to the consumers more likely to respond to them &#8211; I am still talking about marketing to aggregate groups and not individuals (that gets a little too much into privacy), but the groups are much smaller here. This might make Internet advertising rates eventually exceed those of print ads. Newspapers would be foolish to ignore this opportunity. Which is why every newspaper at this point seems to require users to register. As an anonymous reader, you&#8217;re worth so very little to advertisers; as a 27-year old female from the Midwest, you (as part of an advertising group) might be worth much more. More readers and better marketing might help to make up for the decline in print readership.</p>


	<p>But the real kicker is that for many newspapers, the website will <em>never</em> be able to close the gap.</p>


	<p>Online readership growth for any paper must eventually reach a stable plateau where it starts to level off. How do you increase readership to greater levels beyond that? One possibility is to increase the paper&#8217;s website to be more than the news. The New York Times has followed this idea and unveiled sites for interactive applications like <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/">movies</a>, <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/">travel</a>, and <a href="http://homefinance.nytimes.com/">home finance</a>. Another possibility it acquiring outside media sites like <a href="http://www.about.com/">About.com</a> (NY Times) and <a href="http://www.slate.com/">Slate</a> (Washington Post). This helps to some degree, but it can also seem like developing portals in <a href="http://blog.edgeio.com/?p=57">an age where portals are no longer relevant</a>. Personally, I think the opposite approach might be the wave of the future. Stop expecting your readers to live their online lives at your websites and <strong>distribute</strong> your content to them all over the web. But that&#8217;s a topic for the next post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>My NYTIIH Score, Year Two</title>

	<p>It&#8217;s that time of the year again, when the air gets a certain crispness, snatches of holiday song fill the air, and everybody communes with their friends and family, joined in warmth by their shared commitment to one thing: figuring out their <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2005/12/19/calculate-your-nytyiih-score">New York Times Year In Ideas Hipness score</a>. For those of you who missed this last year, I&#8217;ve started the personal tradition of reading through the New York Times Magazine&#8217;s annual <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2006/12/10/magazine/index.html">Year In Ideas</a> issue and tabulating how many of the collected phenomena I had known about beforehand. This is no mere game; a sufficiently high score is the only thing that allows me to still bask in the comfort of being &#8220;with it&#8221;, so please appreciate the seriousness of this moment.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been a bit late coming to the game this year (it&#8217;s been a really busy December), but now is the moment of truth and a big game day question: Now that I actually work at the <em>Times</em>, how will that affect my score? On the one hand, I am that much closer to the elitist, liberal, intellectual mindset the <em>Times</em> is so renowned for, so that should conceivably help my score. But &#8211; and I am painfully aware of the irony here &#8211; I find myself with so much less time to read the news these days now that I&#8217;m actually working for it, which might detract from my score.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;ve never read the Year in Ideas issue, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2006/12/10/magazine/index.html">give it a gander</a> and see how much you recognize. I&#8217;m sure there will be some things you recognize a little, some you&#8217;ve known for years (as the picture shows, I&#8217;m very aware that shipping containers explain everything), and some things that will completely surprise you. And if you&#8217;re feeling competitive, tally up your score and see how intellectually hip you are. My results follow:</p>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, as an experiment I started living in public. By this, I don&#8217;t mean I jumped into the <a href="http://www.furiousseasons.com/archives/2006/12/love_american_style_web_20_and_narcissism_1.html">online exhibitionist extreme</a> that seems to be required for MySpace users, but I have started tracking my media consumption of books/movies/music online. So, as a short post to tide everyone over until I gird myself to continue the <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/11/29/all-the-news-thats-fit-to-serve">never-ending newspapers series</a>, here&#8217;s a review of my year in media.</p>


	<p>In the last year, I read <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/person/harrisj/consumed/book">approximately 63 books</a>, of which the most notable were:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>The Ghost Map, by Steven Johnson</li>
		<li>The Echo Maker, by Richard Powers</li>
		<li>La Perdida, by Jessica Abel</li>
		<li>Maps of the Imagination, by Peter Turchi</li>
		<li>Rip It Up And Start Again, by Simon Reynolds</li>
	</ul>


	<p>This last year I also saw approximately <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/person/harrisj/consumed/movie">67 movies and TV shows</a> (new and rentals), of which the following 5 were the best, in no ranked order:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>The New World</li>
		<li>Little Miss Sunshine</li>
		<li>Aguirre, The Wrath of God</li>
		<li>Grizzly Man</li>
		<li>Veronica Mars, seasons 1&#38;2</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Finally, here were the top 10 bands I listened to last year, courtesy of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/harrisj/">last.fm</a></p>


	<ul>
	<li>Boards of Canada</li>
		<li>Xela</li>
		<li>Sigur RÃ³s</li>
		<li>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</li>
		<li>Ms. John Soda</li>
		<li>Thom Yorke</li>
		<li>The American Analog Set</li>
		<li>Ulrich Schnauss</li>
		<li>Aphex Twin</li>
		<li>Ladytron</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Anyhow, there you have it; my life as a consumer for one year (but am I going to go see movies this weekend? Yes!) Anyhow, happy new year and see you all next year! If you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ve got some more books to read.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Packaging Your First Gem With Hoe</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2007/01/10/packaging-your-first-gem-with-hoe/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My name is Jacob Harris, and I am a rubygem addict. I&#8217;d estimate I have hundreds of them tooling around on my hard drive, useful little snippets of Ruby or C library wrappers or random noodlings. I might not actually use most of them in any of my projects, but like a vast library of unread books, I enjoy having them around. But for the longest time, I&#8217;ve been a freeloader. I&#8217;ve downloaded gems, but I&#8217;ve never written one, but it&#8217;s time I start giving something back.</p>


	<p>And so, I&#8217;ve written my first gem. It&#8217;s nothing incredible &#8211; all things have to start simple &#8211; but I like it. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://amazon-hacks.rubyforge.com/">Amazon Hacks</a> and it consists of two classes (for now) to benefit people whose sites handle Amazon links. The Amazon::Hacks::Link class contains a few methods to extract an <span class="caps">ASIN</span> from any product link, normalize product links, and append an affiliate ID easily. The slightly sillier Amazon::Hacks::Image class puts a convenient Ruby wrapper around the <a href="http://aaugh.com/imageabuse.html">convoluted syntax Amazon uses for its image transformation engine</a>. If you work on a site that links to Amazon product pages (e.g.,  <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/">All Consuming</a>), try it out and let me know if it works for you or it can be improved. It&#8217;s simple to get started, simply run</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>gem install amazon-hacks&#8212;include-dependencies</strong></p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Which brings me to <strong>hoe</strong>. Last night, I gave a talk on hoe to the <a href="http://www.nycruby.org/">NYC.rb group</a> and the slides are here if you want to learn more about the process. </p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/files/hoetalk.pdf">Building Your First Gem With Hoe</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>Before last week, I had no idea of what it takes to create a gem, but it seemed like a lot, and I had better things to distract myself with. And it does indeed require a fair amount of busy work, what I call <em>administrivia</em>, to turn your snippet of Ruby code into a packaged gem, and this work has to be started anew for each gem you want to create. Now, as pragmatic programmers, we learn to automate menial tasks whenever possible, and hoe makes the creation of gems a lot more manageable by automating the busy-work away via a set of useful rake tests. The result is more time for coding, faster releases, and more likely you&#8217;ll release that gem in the first place. So, give hoe a shot, learn about gems, and start writing gems. You&#8217;re a brilliant Ruby coder, it&#8217;s time to share it with the world. And when you write that gem, I&#8217;ve got a cherished spot on my hard drive for it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Blogging? Me?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to just come out and say it, so here we go: I suck at blogging these days. This is not me beating myself &#8211; I don&#8217;t feel bad in the slightest &#8211; I just am acknowledging the truth of the matter. Sorry for any of my readers who haven&#8217;t consigned me to the dustbins of their feed readers yet, but it&#8217;s unlikely I will be producing any riveting content anytime in the near future. I have a lot of changes in my life coming up &#8211; new coop! baby! projects here at the Times! &#8211; that I&#8217;m spent when I get home to blog (of course, thanks to Time-Warner Cable I haven&#8217;t had Internet at home anyway) and don&#8217;t produce any writing that meets my high standards for <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/02/16/original-blogging-content">Original Blogging Content</a> (TM).</p>


	<p>However, I do still have time to feed content into a few other places, for those that need to get their Jake fix. For starters, you can follow the minutiae of my random thoughts (all less then 140 characters) at <a href="http://twitter.com/harrisj">Twitter</a>. In addition, I have started what&#8217;s known as a tumbleblog over on <a href="http://harrisj.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, which is where I will post content that&#8217;s the opposite of Nimble Code: pithy, snarky, non-technical, and varied. Feel free to check both out and one day I will get back to writing here as well.</p>


	<p>Finally, if you were interested in some of the topics from my <a href="http://www.nimblecode.com/articles/2006/11/29/all-the-news-thats-fit-to-serve">Future of Newspapers</a> posts but want to see a professional journalist&#8217;s perspective, I strongly suggest Frontline&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar/">News War</a> series, being broadcast now on <span class="caps">PBS</span> and also viewable on the Web.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Unsafe At Any Speed</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, I almost saw my dog killed in front of my very eyes.</p>


	<p>We were crossing with the light on 7th Avenue in Brooklyn, having just stopped by Cafe Steinhof to say hi to some of the people outside. When an <span class="caps">SUV</span> accelerated into the left turn, I saw a front bumper miss me by an inch and pass over my dog&#8217;s head. I then had to pull her out of the front wheel well before he crushed her and bring her back to the curb. The driver was oblivious to my screaming and kept on down the road. Nobody got the plates, and I was on my way running down a few blocks to the pet hospital with Bella in my arms (when you&#8217;re on adrenalin, a 55-pound dog seems much lighter).</p>


	<p>We should probably rename her &#8220;Lucky.&#8221; After $500 of tests and screening, she may have emerged without much in the way of major injury (I&#8217;m hoping a tear in her Anterior Crucial Ligament isn&#8217;t in the cards though), but she hasn&#8217;t been too happy here at home, even with the pain killers. So, I guess I should be feeling fortunate&#8230;</p>


	<p>But I just feel angry instead. This was not an accident that had to happen, and I think the fact it was a massive <span class="caps">SUV</span> was the cause of the problem. This is not to say that there are no bad drivers for smaller cars, but it&#8217;s a lot harder to run someone over and not notice in a <span class="caps">MINI</span>. The driver did not race away in a panic, we were just a bump in the road, a minor skip for the CD system, nothing to notice. And that was the truly scary part to me. How can car makers talk about the &#8220;safety&#8221; of your vehicle, when they&#8217;re really engineering a decrease in safety for everyone else? And what does this do to our cities, our public places, when we create these speed lanes for the oblivious and disconnected to barrel through without any caution? There is no single point to blame here, but I feel like we&#8217;re engineering a society disconnected from the effects of its actions, insulated from the outside world, and craving more of the same. And that just fills me with sadness this morning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I recently read an old article about SUVs and how they have set safety back (for the drivers of SUVs and people around them). It raises some interesting,  as well as unsettling, points about the motivation of the car makers and the people who buy SUVs.</p>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>the same could be said for semi-trucks as well then i suppose&#8230;</p>


	<p>we blame the <span class="caps">SUV</span>&#8217;s for a lot, but i think we forget to target the full-size truck and full-size van crowd as well.  Same motors, often same drive lines&#8230; why only the flack on the <span class="caps">SUV</span>?</p>


	<p>Not saying i&#8217;m a fan of wasting recourses, just saying there&#8217;s of other things to hate at the same time.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>True, there is some hate I could spread around, but I find the Trucks usually are a lot more considerate of road usage, mainly because the driver is aware he is driving a large machine (as opposed to the inflated car interiors of SUVs). I also think the sight lines are a bit different for light trucks&#8230;</p>


	<p>Of course, those white delivery vans are pretty terrible too. They just haven&#8217;t hit me yet, thank goodness.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>See You at OSCON, Maybe...</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know I haven&#8217;t been posting to this blog much lately (see <a href="http://open.nytimes.com/">this link</a> for one reason why). But I just wanted to note that I will be giving a talk at <span class="caps">OSCON 2007</span> in Portland this week, and I would love to talk to you if you are there.</p>


<ul>
<li class="vevent"><a class="url" href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2007/view/e_sess/12908"><span class="summary">Rails Under The Knife (Jacob Harris)</span></a> <abbr class="dtstart" title="20070726T1435">July 26th, 2:35pm</abbr> to <abbr class="dtend" title="20070726T1520">3:20pm</abbr> (<span class="location">Portland 255</span>)</li>
</ul>

	<p>In addition, my coworker will be giving a talk on the DBSlayer (one of the projects we&#8217;re open sourcing) that should be fun to see.</p>


<ul>
  <li class="vevent"><a class="url" href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2007/view/e_sess/14733"><span class="summary">DBSlayer: Architecting Database Connection Pooling (Derek Gottfrid)</span></a> <abbr class="dtstart" title="20070725T1435">July 25th, 2:35pm</abbr> to <abbr class="dtend" title="20070725T1520">3:20pm</abbr> (<span class="location">Room <span class="caps">E142</span></span>)</li>
</ul>

	<p>Finally, be sure to come to one of our Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions:</p>


<ul>
<li class="vevent"><a class="url" href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2007/view/e_sess/14816"><span class="summary">Using Amazon Webservices <span class="caps">EC2</span>/S3/SQS for computing on large data sets</span></a> <abbr class="dtstart" title="20070725T1930">July 25th, 7:30pm</abbr> to <abbr class="dtend" title="20070725T2030">8:30pm</abbr> (<span class="location">Room <span class="caps">F150</span></span>)</li>
<li class="vevent"><a class="url" href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2007/view/e_sess/14532"><span class="summary">Shaping the Web Future of the Newspaper</span></a> <abbr class="dtstart" title="20070725T2030">July 25th, 8:30pm</abbr> to <abbr class="dtend" title="20070725T2130">9:30pm</abbr> (<span class="location">Room <span class="caps">E143</span>-144</span>)</li>
</ul>

	<p>Now I just have to make it there, which is the subject of another angry post about disconnecting effects of technology, or how United Airlines can oversell flights and then randomly bump  a father and mother with 2-month old infant leaving them to scramble for a flight next day. To be followed by 45 minutes waiting in a customer service line only to be told I&#8217;m supposed to go to a customer service station in the next terminal. Joy!</p>


	<p>The shorter version of this story: United Airlines is a miserable and indecent excuse for a business and when they go bankrupt again, I shan&#8217;t shed a tear&#8230;</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Rails Under the Knife</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After months of rehearsing and revising, I finally gave the talk at <span class="caps">OSCON</span>. I think it could use another month of refinement, but people seemed to enjoy it, and I actually enjoyed giving it as well. If you were at the talk, thank you for coming and feel free to let me know if you have any feedback or questions.</p>


	<p>My talk was <strong>Rails Under the Knife</strong>, a look at the some of the internals of Rails to get a better idea of 3 powerful Ruby techniques:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Metaprogramming</li>
		<li>Reflection</li>
		<li>Blocks</li>
	</ul>


	<p>You can download the slides at</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/harrisj-share/oscon2007.pdf">http://s3.amazonaws.com/harrisj-share/oscon2007.pdf</a> (<em>5mb <span class="caps">PDF</span>!</em>)</li>
	</ul>


	<p>This talk is aimed at an intermediate Rails programmer who knows the basics of Rails coding (I have another similar talk for beginners called Rubyisms in Rails), but still is a bit unsure about the power trio of serious Rails hackery. Hopefully, this will help to provide some inspiration for you to delve into the Rails code on your own. Enjoy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>On Appearing In The Background Behind Two Pulitzer Winners</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harrisj/2397226122/" title="Adventures in Background Lurking by harrisj, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2093/2397226122_9e3649ea39.jpg" width="500" height="360" alt="Adventures in Background Lurking" /></a></p>


	<p>Wow, this is just so unexpected&#8230; Where to begin&#8230;</p>


	<p>Let me start by stating how amazed I am to be here. As a semipro quasi-journalist wannabe, I&#8217;ve been in awe of the Pulitzers for a long time. And while I have daydreamed many a tired morning of winning one, I never seriously believed I would find myself in this spot today: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/07/business/media/07cnd-pulitzers.html?hp">unwittingly standing in the background in a photograph of two Pulitzer winners</a>.</p>


	<p>I wish I could say it was skill: my uncanny knack for being sublimely oblivious to photographers focusing on their actual subjects a few feet in front on me. But I must admit that luck has played a far larger part in my current fortune than most other men might want to admit. If not for the chance proximity of me to these fine Pulitzer winners, my labor would be relegated to obscurity like so many other such pictures, scattered across the negatives and memory cards of so many tourists&#8217; vacations.</p>


	<p>Of course, fate may have delivered me to this moment, but once there my years of training guided to success. I refrained from blinking, I didn&#8217;t pick my nose, I subconsciously stood at the right place to hide the coffee stain on my jeans, all of which made a difference in the selection of this photo over so many others. Luck may deliver you to these opportunities, but once there, it&#8217;s up to your talents to make the most of it.</p>


	<p>But enough about me; sorry I&#8217;m rambling so much, it&#8217;s just such a crazy moment! To riff on Hillary, it certainly takes a village to take a Pulitzer crowd shot, and I have so many people to thank for making this day possible. Obviously, a lot of praise goes to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/walt_bogdanich/index.html">Walt Bogdanich</a> and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/amy_harmon/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Amy Harmon</a> not just for truly excellent reporting that illustrates the power of journalism but also for standing in front of me at the decisive moment.</p>


	<p>To the amazing <span class="caps">NY </span>Times photography desk, for their peerless skill at capturing the moment when the winners are smiling and I don&#8217;t have a dorky look on my face. They make it look easy, but it&#8217;s not! Photography was the key difference in bringing my story to light&#8230; Of course, thanks also go to Graphics and Computer Assisted Reporting, who led the way up the stairs but at a key moment went left while I went right. And to the Web Producers who ran this photo on the website, thus ensuring I had my 15 minutes of Internet fame to blog about. And that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">Website</a> which also gave me a job so that I could one day stand here. Right behind the Pulitzer winners.</p>


	<p>Of course, thanks also go out to Renzo Piano for designing <a href="http://www.newyorktimesbuilding.com/">this new building</a> with its skylight that allows me to be bathed in flattering natural light as opposed to the harsh judgment of flourescent.</p>


	<p>And where would I be without Bill Keller who drove this story every step of the way: from calling the all-hands meeting to naming the awards to pointing out the Pulitzer winners just a few feet from where I haplessly stood.</p>


	<p>Finally, none of this would be possible without the fine work of our publisher Arthur Sulzberger, Jr.. Not only does he continue the best damn newspaper in the whole world. Not only did he give us this fine new newsroom. But he continues  the tradition of championing excellence and integrity in journalism that all of us stand behind.</p>


	<p>For some of us, more literally than others. Thank you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In which the author continues to use a title formulation&#8212;one that seems right out of the 19th century, but these days denotes a certain overweening preciousness well suited to be published by <a href="http://store.mcsweeneys.net/">McSweeney&#8217;s</a>&#8212;to explain his long absence from-,</em></p>


	<p>Ah, screw it. The question on the minds of my remaining readers (all 10 of you) might be where the heck have I been (<em>sorry for the sad invective, but I&#8217;ve been trying to cut down on my cursing for reasons that should soon be clear</em>) and why am I blogging again now? 250-some days is a long day to be quiet, and it&#8217;s not like the blog was that awesome before it went on hiatus. What happened?</p>


	<p>Good question. To be honest, the main reason is I&#8217;ve been rather busy. For starters, I have still been blogging all  this while, but for the New York Times&#8217; open source initiatives at our blog <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/author/harrisj/">Open</a>.  The main reason though is that I am <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harrisj/tags/alex/">a proud father</a>  of the most amazing kid in thr world. It&#8217;s not that the baby keeps me from blogging, rather it&#8217;s just that blogging doesn&#8217;t really compare at all to spending time with him (<em>my personal coding productivity has similarly been very low</em>). Especially since, to be bluntly honest, the writing on this blog had become as boring as listening to a Garrison Keillor marathon. Better not to do it.</p>


	<p>So, why restart now? Because it just feels fun again. And because I actually feel like it might also be <strong>interesting</strong> as well to continue my musings on the future of newspapers (<em>and my experiences and experiments along those lines</em>) in a forum that is not as official and fraught with consequences for misplayed snark like the official New York Times blog would be.</p>


	<p>This is not to say I will be dishing dirt and spilling secrets. I like my job  enough to not want to lose it, and that&#8217;s not really my style. But I think it would be fun (<em>at least to me</em>) to post my occasional rants with perspective from inside the New York Times, and perhaps, if I&#8217;m lucky, fun for some random people on the Interwebs to read it. Sound like a plan?</p>


	<p>If worse comes to worse, I&#8217;ll just stop again. It wouldn&#8217;t be the first time&#8230;</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As regular readers might know, I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/harrisj">Twitter</a>. Perhaps it&#8217;s my lamentably shrinking free time or the general state of fatigue that makes it hard for me to coerce sentences together into a coherent post, but it&#8217;s a lot easier for me to prolifically twitter about all the profound and mundane (<em>okay, pretty much just the mundane</em>) moments in my life. More personal than the <a href="http://harrisj.tumblr.com">referential style of tumbleblogging</a> but also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction">too short to generally encourage overweening preciousness</a>, Twitter hits that nice sweet spot of letting my friends know what I&#8217;m up to, but without it becoming a large chore to do it. Yeah, twitter is stupid, but it&#8217;s the <a href="http://open.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/the-right-kind-of-stupid/">right kind of stupid</a> in the way in which it emphasizes that communication is the glue of community and the ease in which it allows everyone to take part. <a href="http://catbird.tumblr.com/post/35429148">Microblogging is here to stay.</a></p>


	<p>Last week, I gave a talk at the <em>New York Times</em> about Twitter. At the <em>Times</em>, we regularly have lunchtime talks on various educational topics and I thought it would be fun to do one on twitter and why I think it matters (_on a related note, it is interesting to see how various sections in the paper <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?frow=0&#38;n=10&#38;srcht=a&#38;query=twitter&#38;srchst=nyt&#38;submit.x=26&#38;submit.y=7&#38;submit=sub&#38;hdlquery=&#38;bylquery=&#38;daterange=period&#38;mon1=01&#38;day1=01&#38;year1=2007&#38;mon2=05&#38;day2=27&#38;year2=2008">have covered the twitter phenomenon so far</a>). As the developer behind the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nytimes">nytimes twitter feed</a>, I also personally have an interest in seeing how twitter might mesh with more traditional forms of journalism and discuss what we could do further with the feeds, so it seemed like an excellent opportunity to talk about new technology at the Gray Lady. Here are the slides.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://harrisj-share.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter_explained.pdf">Twitter Explained</a> (<em>5MB <span class="caps">PDF</span></em>)</li>
	</ul>


	<p>I was going for a more oblique visual style on the slides, so you might need to infer the context for a few of them, but the general thrust should be apparent. I&#8217;ve also had to redact a couple of slides where I made some suggestions about how the <em>New York Times</em> could expand and enhance its presence on twitter. There was nothing proprietary or wildly radical in them, but I wanted to just head off <a href="http://www.gawker.com/">Gawker</a> or other sites that might erroneously construe them as representing the Grand Official Vision for the New York Times on Twitter. There are some changes I would like to make to the feeds (<em>visual branding of the icons is an obvious one</em>), but my real goal here is to be part of a discussion at the paper and beyond about our place on Twitter and the modern Web at large. Let me know what you think. Thanks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Another Twitter Talk</title>
  <link>http://nimblecode.com/2009/01/10/another-twitter-talk/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not much of a blogger these days. Between my <a href="http://nytimes.com/">day job</a> and some of its <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/">high-priority projects</a> and my spare time at home with my family, including one rambunctious toddler, lengthy self-reflection is not often in the cards, especially since I <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/">blog there too!</a></p>


	<p>But I do <a href="http://www.twitter.com/harrisj">twitter</a>. <a href="http://twitter.grader.com/harrisj">A lot</a>. Which makes sense, because twitter offers me a sweet combination of low demands (<em>even I can do 140 characters of text regularly</em>), convenient access (<em>via all sorts of third-party tools</em>), and the superficial-yet-addictive connectedness of <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/ambient-intimacy/">ambient intimacy</a>. Recently, I was asked to deliver a few introductory talks about twitter at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>&#8212;where I work and where I created the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nytimes">nytimes twitter feeds</a> for my own benefit back in March 2007. I had done this before, but I lost those slides in a laptop malfunction, and I figured it would be fun to start fresh and experiment with a scrolling transition to suggest the fluid nature of twitter timelines. This is hard to see in a <span class="caps">PDF</span>, so I&#8217;m sharing them here in two formats.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://harrisj-share.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter.pdf">PDF</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://harrisj-share.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter.mov">Quicktime</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>Note that this is not the complete presentation. Although none of the information in here is confidential, I&#8217;ve been asked to remove a few slides near the end where I suggest some future directions for twitter usage at the New York Times. I have personally been thinking about twitter and the news a lot recently (more blog posts on that later) and thought it would be cool to suggest some ideas and examples. But I don&#8217;t want anyone to assume I am the Official Strategist for Twitter at the Times and any of my personal musings are corporate or editorial strategy. So, those slides had to go.</p>


	<p>Enjoy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>This is a really nice overview.</p>


	<p>I dug that article you bookmarked about thinking of Twitter as ambient intimacy. One of my favorite articles remains Clive Thompson&#8217;s piece in Wired over a year ago, that still holds strong today:
http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-07/st_thompson</p>


	<p>Ambient intimacy and social proprioception are the two best ways I&#8217;ve seen Twitter described (although, the latter perhaps isn&#8217;t the best term to drop into a casual conversation on why someone should join the service).</p>


	<p>Thanks for sharing.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>So Long Sections?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past few years, there has been no shortage of real and virtual ink devoted to what the future of newspapers might be (although I would prefer if there were <a href="http://www.mattwaite.com/posts/2009/mar/02/build-something-or-stfu/">less writing and more doing</a>). I'm not interested in rehashing <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-dailing/how-to-become-a-death-of_b_178807.html">the teeth-gnashing and grave-dancing</a> in so many of these pieces but instead I'm interested in the way the structure of newspapers will change when they move to a web-only environment. This is the first of a few posts to explore that.

So what might change? For starters, consider the newspaper section. If you look at <a href="http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser/1909/05/27">a newspaper from 100 years ago</a>, it's shocking to see how much content from various beats is jumbled onto pages next to each other. This might be tolerable for a newspaper of only 18 pages, but as newspapers grew in size and scope -- In 2000, the <a href="http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1971.html">New York Times published its largest weekday newspaper ever</a> of 174 pages -- it became necessary to organize stories into sections. Sections make sense for a printed product. They enable a physical organization that allows readers to pick the content they like without an index by pulling out what they like and ignoring the rest. This becomes a selling point in itself for the hypersectionalized Sunday newspaer as highlighted in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPDcshjAwzU">this New York Times ad for the Weekender</a> (and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENu_06t9xl4">ably parodied by the 92nd Street Y Tribeca here</a>). Sections are also reflected in the organizational structure of a modern newsroom, where each desk is an autonomous crew of reporters, editors, designers, etc. all working to create their part of the newspaper.

On the Web however, sections don't really make sense. We don't need the physical grouping and arrangement of stories, because we don't have anything physical to group. We can find the content we want by searching for it, rather than pulling out a section of pages. And yet, if you visit any newspaper website, you'll see the print sections staring right at you with their stories bullet-pointed below. And even if you go to online news ventures, the sections are still there. For instance, here is the organization of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">Huffington Post</a>: <em>Home, Politics, Media, Business, Entertainment, Living, Style, Green, World, and Chicago</em>. You can imagine how a print version of the Huffington Post would be organized by that alone. <a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a> has similar groupings. The <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com">Daily Beast</a> is a little cheekier (<em>Cheat Sheets, Big Fat Stories</em>), but once you click into one of those you see the same sections (arts, science, etc.). This is not to say that classifying content by its sectional subject is useless, but it's funny how a physical scheme continues to predominate online where the need for such an approach is no longer necessary. And how such an approach is stifling serious investigations into other ways of organizing the news.

In many ways, this is akin to your computer's user interface. Unless you're one of those people who does everything in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, you probably interact with your computer via documents, folders, and other concepts designed to make the computer easier to learn by a novice. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor">Desktop Metaphor</a> is why we interact with our 2009 computers by pushing around little icons of things that a 1950s secretary would recognize. What's wrong this approach? Well, what isn't weird about pretending all sorts of data are little documents we can shuffle around virtual file cabinets? And as we add more interlinked and indexed content to our lives, the folder metaphor gets more stretched (what would the physical analog of an alias be? A search folder?). So, why does the desktop metaphor stick around? Possibly because <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/looking_glass/">most alternatives</a> often resort to a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">eyecandy gimmickry</a> more at-home in <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?104">a science fiction movie</a> and the perceived learning curve is too great to switch. But mostly because we've all been trained to think in folders and documents (just like Google's greatest triumph has been to make us search in Google's style). The Desktop Metaphor lives on because through being around so long <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/94591835/warning-a-long-rambly-exploration-of-the-state">it's now become <em>natural</em> to computer users.</a>

So, in that sense, my headline is misleading. Sections will probably persist online, but not without their own drawbacks. Take the issue of context. Articles in the physical newspaper gain an implicit context by their location in the newspaper (<em>is it on the frontpage? is it in the metro section?</em>) that is easily lost online, where that context is not so clear, especially when read in aggregators or search results. In this sense, Google is to newspaper sections what the iTunes store has been to the album. For instance, <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?frow=0&amp;n=10&amp;srcht=a&amp;query=twitter&amp;srchst=nyt&amp;submit.x=33&amp;submit.y=11&amp;submit=sub&amp;hdlquery=&amp;bylquery=&amp;daterange=period&amp;mon1=04&amp;day1=01&amp;year1=2009&amp;mon2=04&amp;day2=30&amp;year2=2009">why the New York Times has published so many articles about Twitter in April</a>? In the printed product where things run in the Dining, World, Technology, etc. it's clear that each story has been produced by different sections working independently (the bottom-up view). On the website where every twitter story falls under Technology, it seems like an overtly directed plan to incessantly promote twitter (the top-down view).

More importantly, I feel like the sectional viewpoint creates artificial silos that compartmentalize the news. Take the really big news stories of our time &mdash; the economic meltdown, swine flu, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, etc. &mdash; and it's very easy to see how parts of these stories touch multiple sections. But the sectional organization obscures the holistic impact of these events by inviting readers to discard parts of the story because they only like reading about national news and not business, etc. Not to mention the difficulties presented to a reader who wants to get up-to-speed quickly on a topic. Picture instead of sections, a topic-driven organization that would provide background and content tied to the big picture rather than the location where the print article would run. Would a newspaper without sections still be a newspaper? Perhaps not, but it's time we killed sections, so the newspaper might live.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You make a very good point. I think your idea of topic-driven sectioning is exactly where online news should evolve. In your article you reference HuffPo, which actually does a pretty decent job of topic-centric coverage. They create several "big-story" pages devoted to topics such as "Obama", "Financial Crisis", and "torture"...

Also, I think you could make the case that one single sectioning scheme is also going to change. With the ability of most CMS's to add several pieces of meta-info to each story, or tags, there might be a case to be made of providing the user with several different classification schemes, and letting them use whatever makes sense... Geographical, big news vs small news, topic-driven, and more...]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the interesting take! For me, reading this raised the question ... will websites of the future take on the simplistic design of Google since all we really need is that search box? Or, ultimately, will Google be the internet’s ONLY website? 

Let me blow the dust off the music example: People are no longer trading records, 8-tracks, cassettes and CDs; they are trading music in the form of data. The same could happen (is happening) to information we report. 

The downside of this discussion is we can only search what we know. Categories provide us a jumping off point for where we can expand our knowledge base. I love drinking gin and tonic, but sometimes I need to look at the menu to see what else the bar has to drink.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sorry if I'm not being clear, but I guess what I'd like to explore is a better way of bringing trending topics into focus in a single place rather than splitting sections. Admittedly the technology is there already, but I still am not entirely happy with how topic pages work and I wonder if it would be better to have editors assigned to beats like "The Iraq War" and "Swine Flu" rather than sections like International or the Arts. Does that make sense?]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wasn't paying close enough attention, but now I see what you're driving at. A "topic" in your lexicon, means something current and probably continuing, and almost certainly not anticipated by the formal "sections" which are defined in advance. In that case, I totally agree! If there's a revolution in Suriname led by a performance poet, sparked by blog reports of corporate corruption in healthcare (I have no inside knowledge, just a made-up scenario), does that story fall under the business beat, Latin America, literature, health care, web? The usual approach from an editor's point of view is to force it into one bucket -- one reporter (probably just a wire service reader, most likely). If it becomes an investigative story, then an editor may create a task force, with someone to capture video of the leader's performances, someone to check the business history of the company involved, etc. 

But I would still recommend reading up on taxonomy vs. folksonomy, for instance here: http://tr.im/mOKV]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jacob,

Great thoughts. I think it's critical that newspapers find a way to be the best place to learn about the news, rather than search engines. 

You make a useful point that the topical sections of traditional papers are probably not really optimized for what's needed online and how users think about finding content. It's always interesting how historical habits transparently become implicitly entrenched over time.

I'd like to comment on this line from your post:

"We can find the content we want by searching for it, rather than pulling out a section of pages."

I suspect you didn't mean only external search, but also internal search engines. But the challenge is that users don't use internal search engines enough; far, far less than external search engines (mainly G.)

Putting newspapers in a historical perspective, they really were both places to learn about what news is important and places to read the actual articles. They were content producers and content aggregators. 

But online, they are increasingly the last step in a transaction for content; about 50% of users come from google search or google news to typical news sites and they read 1, _maybe_ 2 articles on the news site before leaving. 

This is bad, and hard to monetize. 

So thinking about ways to be the best place to learn about news content is really, really critical. Maybe that's better on-site search, better topics, external links, discovery tools, personalization, whatever. It's more than changing sections or tag-clouds. Article pages need a complete make-over. But it's critical to solve this problem in order to maintain audience or brand equity long term.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi, saw your post at Nieman Journalism Lab.  These are really good points.  I think you're on target that if newsrooms can reduce or get rid of the bureaucratic structure (Page 1, National desk, A&amp;E, Sports, etc.) that divides up the job responsibilities into sections that mimic the physical structure of the printed product, we'd see our mental metaphors and our workflows become more useful as we move onto the Web.  Maybe this would help improve the print product too -- the default structure encourages not only blindness to what other sections are up to with overlapping topics but territoriality (I often see people getting pissy because of a suggestion to print content from another desk or team in "their" section or pages or because another team did "their" story). 

Maybe get rid of individual section editors in lieu a "taxonomy" or "sectioning" editor who makes sure all the content is tagged appropriately and divides up the news budget for both print and online posting?  And also, revise the news budgeting systems so that you don't have to plan for and slot the content according to the physical sections in print, but according to topics or some other platform-independent way.  Just seeing that piece of paper in the news meeting change could be a powerful tool for revising how editors think and place content in context.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've seen the taxonomy tension played out before with interesting results, Jacob, and I'd second Scott's referral to Weinberg. 

In my client experience with major news companies, there is often resistance to moving away from the holy tablets of section-based taxonomy. And it's been an editorial team-led resistance, or sometimes an argument for remaining attentive to user needs. Both hold merit, but as you say, the technology and need to compete are driving us to push the model in bolder directions.

It is happening, although some such projects haven't seen the light of day yet. I think the kicker, from my own experience, is that advertising and biz strategy is driving a lot of the web editorial innovation coming down the road. 

I've seen sophisticated ad strategies enthrone new models of organizing content at other media and entertainment companies. (Much of this follows topical aggregations, executed to varying levels of technical and revenue-driving ingenuity.) News orgs will not be immune.

I wish I could be less oblique, but as it goes, the most interesting work being undertaken by ad/design agencies in digital today is swathed in non-disclosure agreements. What I can say is that strategic reboots of taxonomy have become a distinctive pillar of intellectual property at big content organizations. In that respect, there's a lot to come.

Cheers,
Jeff]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've had a contentious relationship with Dave Winer.

I know he likes to ruffle feathers and make outrageous statements. I know he can veer between outright hostility and then overweening sensitivity. We have different opinions on many things, but generally I've shrugged it off; I actually am a media hacker with work to do. But recently, I lost my cool. Dave Winer has had a long-running hostility to Twitter's <a href="">Suggested User List</a> (SUL), because he feels it puts Twitter in the role of <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/12/whyItsTimeToBreakOutOfTwit.html">king-maker promoting certain accounts over others</a>. I personally feel it's Twitter's site and they can do what they want, and there makes some sense in them indicating some accounts for people to start with (as full disclosure: I should note that the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nytimes">@nytimes</a> account has been on the SUL off and on at various points). But then the argument veers through the looking glass.

Twitter created the SUL because they felt it would be good for new users to subscribe to a bunch of prominent accounts (eg, news sources, tech people, celebrities), although this admittedly makes accounts on the list prominent in themselves. But in Dave's evolving argument, Twitter instead is a sinister puppet-master that purposefully places tech bloggers and media companies on the list so they will be beholden to twitter and promote the company further. The argument goes like this:

<ol>
<li>Being on the SUL is worth an "obviously" tremendous value that has conveniently never been approximated (For a while, Dave and others quoted <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/12/how-much-is-a-suggested-slot-on-twitter-worth-jason-calacanis-offers-250000/">Jason Calacanis' $250K a month offer</a> to be on the list, but <a href="http://twitter.com/JasonCalacanis/status/1939303783">he has admitted that was a joke.</a>)</li>
<li>Twitter and recipients understand the value of being on the SUL and Twitter uses it to keep bloggers and media companies in line.</li>
<li>The value of this is so immense that it </li>
</ol>

Since being on the SUL is worth an immense (but never quantified) value, these companies in turn cannot help but be indebted to twitter. And so they are collectively guilty by association. He started by maligning TechCrunch and <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/04/12/doesMashableHaveCredibilit.html">Mashable</a>. Since then, twitter's dark web of corruption has apparently expanded even to the Gray Lady, and this skein of an argument reached its absurd apotheosis when Winer accused the New York Times of running <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/technology/personaltech/07basics.html?_r=1&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=twitter&amp;st=Search">a personal technology how-to about twitter clients</a> as a payback to Twitter:

<blockquote>BTW, I love the way the NY Times, a member of the S.U.L. ran a tutorial for Twitter newbies. A little quid pro quo?? Perhaps? &mdash; <a href="http://friendfeed.com/davew/e0f3f83c/btw-i-love-way-ny-times-member-of-u-l-ran-tutorial">Dave Winer</a></blockquote>

Because really, why else would the New York Times run a how-to on twitter in a personal technology column of all places unless commanded by the dark hand of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ev">Ev</a>?

 as his latest argument <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/05/29/isThereValueInBeingOnTheSu.html">latest argument</a> (since rewritten to remove the reference to the Times and me) was that the NYT was in thrall to Twitter. He continues this point in a comment:

<blockquote>The question is this -- when the NYT is put on the SUL have they received something of value? The only way they can accept it, imho, is if it has zero value. They write a lot of articles about Twitter. It would be like reviewing Ford cars, and then Ford giving them a fleet of cars. They can buy the cars from Ford and review them, nothing wrong with that. But they can't receive them for free. And they certainly can't receive them without telling people, when they read a car review, that they have a potential bias in
favor of one of the companies.

That's the issue. Not whether it has precedent or not -- of course it does.  There are dirty publications everywhere. At first it was understandable that there was some confusion, and Twitter didn't ask in advance if they wanted to be on the list. But this has been going on for a number of weeks now, so the excuse is wearing out. &mdash; <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/05/29/isThereValueInBeingOnTheSu.html#comment-10283126">Dave Winer</a></blockquote>

And that is the moment where I lost it. To provide some background, I had been asking <a href="http://friendfeed.com/davew/e60477ec/harrisj-i-ve-found-ways-to-measure-that-too-and">Dave Winer</a> what his calculation for the value of being on the SUL was, since it's the linchpin of his theory (now that the $250K one was out the window). In this post, instead of exploring the question, he decided to double down on his previous attacks. And so I commented the following (<em>Dave Winer refused to approve this comment and suggested I should run it on my own blog instead.</em>):

<blockquote>I would have to disagree with your application on this point. It's a rather simplistic value of conflict of interest that rests on two tenuous assumptions. 

The first is that the SUL has a tremendous value to companies like the NY Times (despite your assertion that it's self-evident, I have yet to see any real effort from you to define its value). So let's try. You suggest the companies linked on the SUL get large amounts of traffic that drives ad revenue. From my experience, clickthrough rates from twitter have been astonishingly low (you can look at the bit.ly stats on any nytimes feed). But let's look at the Onion, which has the advantage of being able to craft its own news rather than rely on reality. So, 800K+ followers. For a given link posted to twitter, ~8000 clickthroughs. Let's assume a $5 CPM ad rate to be generous (probably lower). Total worth of each tweet = $40. KA-CHING! For very large media companies, it's even worse. Much as I like twitter and the conversation on it, as a traffic driver it's extremely small, and I guess you would actually have to measure the worth of SUL-driven follower traffic in relative terms rather than absolute to be accurate (if I give $10 to someone who has $100, it's much more significant than to someone with $10 million). I welcome other ways of estimating the worth of being on the SUL, but right now it might as well be measured in magic beans (or joke pricing by Calacanis). I think you recognize that the value is small, which is why you think any value at all is suspect, but I think that's a reductive argument to, since it might as well be stated as "media companies should not be on the Internet at all, since any traffic from other sites (whether directly or by suggested user lists) has some value and any value is suspect." Which leads me to assumption two.

The second assumption is that the normal mechanisms that separate the newsroom from the business/marketing side of the operation somehow are not working here. Amazingly enough, the New York Times receives significant real cash transactions from companies every day. It's called advertising, and you've already written about the "Chinese wall" that separates the business/marketing operations of newspapers from the editorial production side. Do you find yourself doubting the neutrality of the Times when you see an Apple ad on the front page? What makes being on the Twitter suggested user list different? Especially since unlike an ad, it seems to have a very nebulous value.

Finally, I don't really see what excuse needs to be proffered and why we actually care whether twitter has the NYT on the SUL. It's their site and they can do what they want. RSS feed readers can put the Times as an initial feed. You can tweet our articles in your twitter stream. It would only be an excuse if there were a problem, and calling the New York Times a dirty publication (like you have smeared Mashable and others before) merely because Twitter thinks that some users might be interested in a feed of NY Times articles seems like a trial by innuendo.</blockquote>

As I stated before, this comment was blocked, so I have repeated it here verbatim to show my argument. I admit I was angry and in that way I may have reflected poorly on the Times, but I feel like if you're going to make one of the most serious charges in journalism (conflict of interest), it had better be on evidence a lot less flimsy than this. ]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, Jay Rosen pointed that <a href="http://friendfeed.com/jayrosen/fdfbfbcb/okay-friendfeed-friends-little-url-shortener">Bitly analytics seemed to report many more hits than other URL shorteners</a>. The problem looked eerily familiar; and then I realized it was the same issue I had observed a few months back and had even half-written a blog post about it that never got posted (<em>if you read my blog, this should come as no surprise</em>). In the interest of explaining things thoroughly, here finally is a post on the matter.

<a href="http://www.bit.ly/">Bitly</a> has become the preeminent URL shortening service, largely due to the fact that it provides easy access to analytics on usage (<a href="http://bit.ly/TWf3E+">you merely need to append a plus-sign to the shortened URL</a>). This is the reason I converted all of the automated New York Times twitter accounts over to bitly 3-4 months ago, in the hopes of sharing the analytics of twitter user behavior with the world. However, when I collected a month worth of link usage statistics from Bitly, I noticed that the quoted total seemed unusually high, a 3-5x multiplication of hits recorded by our page analytics software. At first I thought it might be a result of comparing apples to oranges: the bitly counts might include other users shortening the same URL, and internal analytics is undercounting twitter traffic since very few twitter users come to the site via twitter.com.

Fortunately, though I have a way to check apples directly against apples. When my automated script posts a URL to twitter, it appends a query string to the URL before shortening to indicate that the click is coming from a twitter client (and also which account). So, if you look at the URL for <a href="http://bit.ly/TWf3E">this movie review of <em>District 9</em></a> posted to the <a href="http://twitter.com/nytimes/statuses/3293094459">nytimes twitter account last week</a> you'll notice it has some additional arguments on the end:

<em>http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/movies/14district.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes</em>

you can see it has <em>?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes</em> appended to the end of it. This allows me to tag all hits from my automated accounts and compare directly the numbers from bitly (because nobody else is shortening that specific URL) to the numbers reported from internal analytics (because those hits are coming solely from the automated accounts). The really savvy among might notice I can also distinguish traffic from different accounts on twitter. But this is where the discrepancy became apparent. Here are the counts for that URL in bitly and internal analytics

<ul>
<li>WebTrends: 928 hits</li>
<li>Bitly: 1505 hits (<strong>162%</strong>)</li>
</ul>

The difference can vary depending on the link. Some counts can be very close. But a few months back, I saw overcounts up to 4-5x greater for Bitly. So, what's happening here? I contacted Bitly support about it and they explained the issue is that Bitly counts expansions of the URL and not necessarily clickthroughs. At first, this seemed like a design flaw in the service, but I realize it's an unavoidable limitation of <strong>every</strong> URL shortener out there, and the problems are probably most apparent with Bitly because they are the most prominent one in use. Let me explain.

A URL shortener works in a particular way. A user sees a short URL like http://bit.ly/TWf3E. The web browser sends a request to the bitly web server for that page. The bitly server counts that as a hit and sends an HTTP redirect reply back to the web browser with the expanded URL which the browser then hops to. This is how it should work, and in an ideal world the subsequent request would register a hit on the real destination. <strong>But bitly has no way to know if the user followed the redirect.</strong> It could be the user's machine crashed. It could be that the browser doesn't follow redirects. It could be it's a web crawler that gets counted by bitly but is ignored by the real site's analytics. Or it could be a tool that does the request only to display the expanded URL to a user. All of these scenarios could be counted as a "hit" at the shortener without being a clickthrough to the remote site.

To their credit, bitly has recognized the problem and have been working on various mechanisms to reduce this overcounting, and I've seen a definite "drop" in bitly counts as more filters are added to remove bogus hits. This has included filtering out bots by recognizing signatures of their actions. And it also has included the addition of an <em>expand</em> method in the API for developers looking to expand URLs without requesting the web page and being counted (it also returns statistics on clicks). But no countermeasures will be perfect. Some bots may be hard to detect. And there are several reasons why developers might prefer to expand Bitly URLs by making a HTTP GET request like web browsers do instead of calling the API: it's simpler to use, it doesn't require an API key, and it's all but guaranteed to be more reliable. If bitly is having catastrophic issues, which service do you think is going to get the most attention? The public website or the niche developer API? Apart from doing the right thing, there's not much incentive for any developer to use a shortener's API just to expand URLs. And so, it's likely that some overcounting will always be with us for any URL shorteners.

So, who cares? The ugly truth about web analytics is nearly all of it involves some amount of error. The phrase should be <strong>Lies, damned lies, and web analytics</strong>. Analysis of web server logs can overcount automated traffic from web crawlers. Modern analytics programs that embed javascript on pages to thwart bots can undercount clients that don't load the entire page or don't execute javascript (a particular concern with mobile browsers). Panel-driven approaches like Nielsen can severely undercount because they extrapolate from focus group that might not closely represent the actual Internet audience. Some techniques might be more accurate than others, but the central problem of web analytics is that you never know for certain how many of your visitors are actually humans. And it gets even fuzzier when you attempt to discern unique visitors from the flow of hits that are your site's traffic; any estimation of visitors is built on assumptions about web usage and thus adds its own levels of distortion and error. I would hope many web analytics experts understand this and approach stats with appropriate grains of salt. For instance, if I see a surge in bitly clickthroughs for a New York Times article on twitter, is that incontrovertible evidence that twitter-themed stories are eagerly consumed by the twitter users? Or is it more a case of automated bots grabbing and expanding any link tagged twitter? Or is it both? You'll never know with absolute certainty.

This point matters, because bitly is one of the only truly open analytics out there. And people quotes its numbers like they come straight from God, often because they have no alternatives. Most companies (my employer included) will not share their statistics with the general public, although I have not yet chased down the reason why. And bitly hits are recorded at the origin of folllowing a link, rather than the destination, making them essential for understanding a service like twitter. But such ubiquity also deserves some skepticism. That certain argument about the worth of twitter followers suffers if actual traffic is half or a tenth what is reported. That outside audit of site traffic might include many small errors adding up to a big deviation from internal numbers. Bitly remains a highly useful service, but it's important for all of us to remember how the hits are counted.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In our recent study TWITTER: The Dark Side - Does Bitly Enables Massive Click Fraud we have proven that statistics Bit.ly provides is egregiously inaccurate at best and fraudulent at worst. Bit.ly counts cyberspace’s ghosts and drones, bots and crawlers, presenting them all as humans.

They do not discriminate between real and robotically generated automatic clicks with no actual human behind the click.

We even have found one single bitly link wiht more than million clicks (1,677,769 to be precise)  without a single human behind it. This in-depth analysis could be found here:

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've recently become more and more skeptical of web analytics systems like Google Analytics and Web Trends because it's tough to take a pass-through click tracker (like bit.ly), an image or script based tracker and log file analysis to even vaguely resemble one another. It seems like each method leaves something big out. The click trackers miss clicks that go around them (if they use a redirect), the image/scrip trackers often get blocked by anti-malware software, and logfiles miss content hits cached upstream.

@roman - I'm not surprised that that is bots are being counted.]]></wp:comment_content>

RE: why companies won't reveal click/download statistcs, many just don't want to do this openly without knowing where they stand in relation to their competitors. Unilateral dissemination of this information may lead to an approving slap on the back from the few interested public consumers, but leaves the generous provider vulnerable to attack. Few will indulge in the nuances of web analytic accuracy, so the raw numbers are likely to be interpretted and digested as is. One could imagine how a non-sharing competitor could lure advertising dollars away by cladestinely providing better traffic numbers to clients; numbers hard for the generous company to dispute if they are not public.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Back in the heady days of 2008, one of my nicknames in the newsroom was <em>Mr. Twitter</em>, due to my work on the <a href="http://twitter.com/nytimes">@nytimes</a> twitter account (and other automated pages) and my work (with others here at the NYT) to coax more members of the <em>Times</em> into <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/twitter">signing up for twitter on their own.</a> I have always found Twitter's spartan user experience fascinating: the short message sizes, the basic social networking layer, the unrelenting emphasis on communication instead of social or professional networks; as I explained in <a href="/2009/01/10/another-twitter-talk/">a few talks I delivered here at the Times</a>, Twitter was compelling because on the surface it offered so little functionality to users, it leaves people to do what they do best, and talk away the silences one status update at a time.

So perhaps unsurprisingly, Twitter's brevity has been an impetus for user-created inventions. Now-official conventions like the @reply and hashtags (<em>I perhaps am the only one disappointed they aren't called octothorpetags</em>) originated as user-invented conventions to scaffold in useful functionality despite twitter's limitations. But text markup can only do so much. For much richer communication like photos, videos, music, twitter falls short and can only send users elsewhere to pick up pieces of the conversation.

For users who want to attach photos or other media to their messages, the only option has been to post the content on the third-party website and embed the link in a tweet. Furthermore, given the space constraints of twitter, it is often necessary to use a URL shortening service that acts as a proxy and provides a compact URL that is expanded into the full URL upon a request. The limitations of such services have been noted many times by now; these include <a href="http://urlshorteningservicefortwitter.com/">obfuscation</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2009/04/04/why-url-shorteners-s.html">fragility</a>, <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/08/09/trim-shuts-down/">impermanence</a>, and a <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/12/international-domains-url-shortener.html">disconcerting association with the nation of Libya</a>.

But the biggest drawback of using third-party websites for hosting photos and videos is that it wrenches the reader out of the firehose of the status update stream and forces them to visit the rest of the web. And it's scary out there. Such transitions can be jarring (<em>Not to mention impossible for users of SMS or the <a href="http://www.twitterpeek.com/">Peek twitter devices</a></em>), and have only been tolerated thus far by the status update services because there has been no alternative. <em>Until now.</em>

Introducing <strong>TweetFTP</strong> (the Tweet File Transfer Protocol), a revolutionary new approach for sharing files within the contents of tweets themselves. It works by encoding a file to be transferred as a series of encoded tweets (plus a few header and footer tweets). No more guessing whether to use <a href="http://twitpic.com/">Twitpic</a> or <a href="http://www.yfrog.com/">YFrog</a>. No more having to wrench yourself out of the stream just to see a picture of someone's sandwich. No more having to post your photos to some randomly named photo-service that'll run out of funding in 3 months. TweetFTP instead stores them in twitter's servers which operates in the cloud somewhere. And everything important is in the Cloud these days, so tweetftp is <strong>like a floppy disk in the sky</strong>! And it fully embraces all of Twitter's conventions: Want to send a file to one person instead of the world? Prefix the tweets with their username; want to tag a public file with keywords, use all the hashtags you want to describe it. Don't work against twitter, but embrace it; send that photo to Grandma in only 35,693 tweets!

However, there are some caveats. Currently, the only language support is <a href="http://github.com/NYTimes/tweetftp">hastily coded Ruby driver</a>, although this standard is Open Source and I expect other drivers will be created shortly. In addition, twitter's API currently places some artificial constraints on transmission speed. Twitter currently allows API clients to only post up to 150 messages per hour. This practically limits this mechanism to a maximum speed of 0.019kbps. But do not despair! Serious users of twitter may apply for an elevated rate limit of 20,000 requests per hour, which increases throughput to a comparatively blazing 2.51kbps. A bigger problem is that this mechanism might be used for illegal file sharing. And indeed, since it only takes a mere 60,000 or so tweets (or about 17 days) to upload an MP3, it would be pretty hard to resist that temptation. I can only appeal to user's moral judgment to ensure tweetftp is only used for the right reasons.

So there you have it. To learn more, please read the <a href="http://github.com/NYTimes/tweetftp">tweetftp specification</a> and let me know if you implement support for it in your own favorite language. I'll send you a badge for for blog. Via tweetftp!

  <title>The Appeal of Annotations</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, I had the honor of speaking at Twitter's Chirp conference, where I talked a little about some of the <em>New York Times'</em> <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/anywhere">upcoming integration of @anywhere</a>, and share some fun statistics I had unearthed along the way. For instance, <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/how-often-is-the-times-tweeted/">someone tweets a link to a New York Times story once every 4 seconds.</a> Like most developers there, I will admit to some mixed feelings about the conference beforehand, but I was pleasantly surprised about some of the features on the twitter roadmap (and I enjoyed meeting some of the developers there face-to-face). The most exciting feature? <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/fa5da2608865453">Annotations.</a>

This upcoming feature allows programs to submit up to 2K worth of annotations with a tweet. Annotations themselves are triples of a namespace, key, and value, and there are relatively few restrictions beyond that. Presumably multiple values for a given key are allowed, although it's unclear yet how they will be represented in the format. Beyond that, twitter is stepping back, preferring to see what standards and conventions emerge from the developer community rather than dictating the usage of annotations.

It's a smart decision, but not one without drawbacks; too much passivity could lead to early fragmentation and confusion: for instance, we'll probably see a proliferation of various annotation formats for the <em>url</em>, <em>info</em>, and possibly even <em>media</em> namespaces. Such confusion might delay the adoption of annotations by twitter clients, since inconsistent annotations are harder to support than none at all. Of course, it is also possible that the most prominent clients may carve out their own specific functionality via privately documented annotations. And so, there might be a <em>tweetdeck</em> or <em>seesmic</em> namespace before there are general ones. And so, while I think Twitter, Inc. should indeed stay away from specifying annotations, I think it would be very helpful if they provided an official space (perhaps a wiki on <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/">dev.twitter.com</a> for developers to document and discuss some possible uses for annotations. And it would be great if a few suggestions were already there for developers looking to get started before annotations. So, what kind of annotations might make sense? Here are some thoughts of mine:

<ul>
<li><strong>Url Information</strong> I don't think <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/04/09/howTwitterCanKillTheTwitte.html">annotations will eliminate tiny URLs from tweets</a> (at least not in the next few years), but I do think it makes sense for annotations to contain expanded or canonical URLs for the tiny URLs mentioned in the body. This would allow researchers to analyze URLs years after the shortener vanishes (although it could also create an opportunity for phishing where the tinyURL does NOT go to the canonical destination provided).
<li><strong>Media</strong> - the <a href="http://video.search.yahoo.com/mrss">MediaRSS</a> standard seems like a natural fit for services like <a href="http://twitpic.com/">Twitpic</a> and <a href="http://yfrog.com/">YFrog</a>, allowing tweets to specify thumbnail URLs, dimensions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Product information</strong> - <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/what_twitter_annotations_mean.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> wrote an extensive piece about annotations where they suggested that existing product identifiers like ISBNs or other such things would make for excellent annotation material. I agree. 
<li><strong>Urgency</strong> - some sort of mechanism for indicating that some tweets are breaking news or urgent in some other way has been suggested by a few developers I spoke with. Of course, this could be abused by that one guy you know who always sends all his emails with maximum priority.
<li><strong>Meta</strong> - A namespace for specifying information about the annotations in the document. It's unclear if we would one one place for this, or a meta key in each namespace.</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong> - Finally, with the <tt>font-family</tt> key, you CAN tweet in Comic Sans. This is me being silly, but one could theoretically see some artsy use cases for tweet-specific CSS styling specified via annotations.</li>
<li><strong>Linked Data</strong> - The most intriguing potential use case of annotations is Linked Data. Most tweets from the <a href="http://twitter.com/nytimes">@nytimes</a> twitter feed are stories with internal cataloging information that says what the story is about (the people, the places, organizations, etc.). This information is useful in itself, but <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/more-tags-released-to-the-linked-data-cloud/">when it is linked to an outside taxonomy like DBPedia</a>, it becomes compatible with global taxonomies. Meaning, you can search for tweets tagged 'Twitter (Organization)' and find stories tagged with any of the linked taxonomies.</li>
</ul>

These are just a few ideas off the top of my head, and I'm looking forward to what proposals other developers might make. Of course, the real killer use of annotation is not in displaying tweets on the timeline but search and the streaming API. Imagine being able to retrieve tweets tagged with a certain annotation key, or key/value, or even with a certain namespace. Combine this with a generalized annotation scheme like Linked Data and it's suddenly possible to search for all tweets with images or links to books or stories about fine dining. Or so the hopes go. Reality will likely be messier.

For starters, adoption of annotations will probably be halting and inconsistent (that's the subject of another post), largely dependent on the abilities of twitter client developers to make it happen. Text search is not going away anytime soon. And annotations will not eliminate confusion in themselves. For instance, it seems to me that the majority of annotation use cases will be to describe what the tweet is linking to, rather than the contents of the tweet itself. Similarly, I imagine we will see usage of automated annotation in some clients where the word Paris in the text leads to the tweet being annotated as being about Paris the City, when it's really not at all. Of course, this is all just quibbling that <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/messing-around-with-metadata/">would make a research librarian proud</a>, but it matters to some.

Still, let's not lose our enthusiasm for annotations. This could be big, and I'm excited to see where it will wind up. Let's get out there and start coding.

<strong>Update:</strong> And then just like that, Facebook announced the <a href="http://opengraphprotocol.org/">Open Graph Protocol</a> which among other things, specifies an annotation namespace that can include things like book information, people mentioned, etc. It's an attractive standard defined for Facebook's "Like" mechanism that will probably be quickly adopted within Twitter annotations as well. Unfortunately, with the exception of UPCs and ISBNs, all Open Graph fields are arbitrary text. This means there will still be a lot of ambiguity within the annotations compared to Linked Data (for instance, people might tag "Barack Obama", "Obama", "Barack Hussein Obama", "President Obama" all for tweets about Obama), but it also means there might be greater usage.]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jacob,

I think you are spot on in your initial recommendations of what metadata Twitter annotations might be include.  

I agree that Linked Data / Semantic Web schema could be particularly useful. It could massively scale search effectiveness and distribution opportunities while allowing sophisticated on-the-fly analysis of Twitter's firehose &amp; other feeds. 

The Twitter ecosystem is particularly suited to applying principles of the Semantic Web in that machine interpolated meaning and “Twitter Resonance” could be continually refined the more humans tweet &amp; retweet about the same and related topics (resolved by semantic entity detection; coupled with author, location, hashes, platform, temporal and other information.

The Marshall Kirkpatrick RWW piece you referenced suggests that Twitter intends to leave the annotation classification system to be determined by the market.

@ZacharyCohen today opined today, “that social media, in its purest form, is our generations’ destiny hammer." http://bit.ly/9TwZ2T

I suspect the conversation on how Twitter annotation metadata standards might best serve potential services is just beginning.  I hope to find your thoughtful voice joining others in this rare opportunity to help shape an attribute of a powerful social media tool.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <title>Waves of Annotation</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Two weeks after the announcement (and some big waves by Facebook), there still seems to be serious interest in Twitter annotations. And yet, we have to wonder how much annotations will catch on, especially since it will be built from loosely coordinated actions among a large number of players.

I am admittedly no futurist, but I'll take a stab at prognostication. For starters, I'd avoid waxing rhapsodically about our glorious semantic-web future. I would say it'll be at least six months or more until we see widespread client usage of twitter annotations, and it may be that only a small fraction of tweets will be annotated even in the next few years. Progress may be fitful and sporadic, driven in the early days by some major adopters. Most users will remain unaware of the functionality or opt out.

How can I guess the future? By looking at the past. Twitter has already introduced a level of annotation to tweets: geolocation. And they didn't exactly take off like wildfire. <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/11/think-globally-tweet-locally.html">Five months after its launch</a>, geotagged tweets are still a rarity in the general stream (<a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation#Sampling">a few hours of the Twitter Sampling API</a> revealed only about 0.85% of tweets collected had locations). Of course, annotations are not exactly the same as geolocation: users may be more interested in sharing what books they're talking about than where they are; but they suggest a general model for adoption that will probably remain true. I'm guessing we'll see the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=nwiwcW8Y2Ds&amp;feature=fvw">waves of annotation</a>:

<strong>Wave 0: Early Hacking</strong> When Twitter Annotations launch, expect to see an initial burst of one-off hacks where developers put it through the motions and play with possibilities both silly and sublime. Annotations will probably roll out with a developer wiki/emailing list that means that some standards will coalesce pretty quickly, although some may fall out of favor in later stages.

<strong>Wave 1: Automated Tweets</strong> (<em>1-3 months later</em>) The next major wave of annotated tweets will come when various websites that automatically tweet add the metadata they have to their messages. For instance, we'll probably see the following annotations pretty quickly off the bat:
<ul>
<li><a href="">MediaRSS</a> or similar extensions for describing photographs on photo-posting services like <a href="http://www.twitpic.com/">TwitPic</a> or <a href="http://yfrog.com/">YFrog</a></li>
<li>Product information alongside "Tweet This Product" links from retailers like Amazon. This will probably include UPC or ISBN as well as links to a purchasing page.</li>
<li>Book-specific metadata from sites like <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> or <a href="http://www.readernaut.com/">Readernaut</a> where users rate books they have just read. Many of thess sites will likely use Facebook's <a href="http://www.opensocialgraph.com/">Open Graph Protocol</a>, since they will already want Facebook integration as well.</li> 
<li>"Like" actions on various websites. Here we'll probably see a tussle between the <a href="http://www.opensocialgraph.com/">Open Social Graph</a> and <a href="http://activitystrea.ms">Activity Streams</a> standards.
<li>News-specific metadata from news feeds. This might include generalized concepts like <em>urgency</em> or the <em>byline</em> or <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/announcing-the-timestags-api/">publisher-specific metadata</a>. Linked Data would be helpful to connect stories across various taxonomies.</li>
</ul>
Automated services may very well remain the predominant source of annotated tweets. For instance, remember that figure about geotagged tweets earlier? <a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare checkins</a> accounted for 32% of them, and I imagine it would be higher if I ran my sample at night. More on that below.

<strong>Wave 2: General Standards Emerge</strong> (<em>2-4 months</em>) In the beginning, everybody will probably annotate alone: Amazon will probably use an <em>amazon</em> namespace, the New York Times will use <em>nyt</em>, and every twitter photo-sharing site will probably use the <em>media</em> namespace in widely different ways. In other words, everybody tweets alone, using their own terminology and taxonomies to organize it. So, searches for things like tweets about books or Barack Obama returning only a fraction of annotated tweets. Ultimately, certain conventions will predominate (whether adapted from existing standards or created entirely new), precisely because it's easier to build tools against a few standards than many. 

<strong>Wave 3: Client Support</strong> (<em>6-9 months</em>) Eventually, some API clients will add support for annotation within the client. I doubt clients or the twitter website will just add direct fields for entering annotation triples; that would be a user-experience disaster. Instead, we will probably see the following features rolled out once the automated tweeting services have established some standards:
<ul>
<li>Display of extended URL information contained within tweets.</li>
<li>Displaying thumbnails or other metadata from annotated picture tweets.</li>
<li>ISBN and UPC lookup against Amazon or other retailers (with purchasing links, naturally)</li>
<li>Allowing the user to explicitly annotate tweets about books or movies via a pop-up wizard.</li>
<li>If Facebook adds Open Social Graph annotation for user statuses, then many clients that support posting to both Twitter and Facebook will likely add annotations using the Open Social Graph namespace.</li>
</ul>
I would guess though that automated services will always be the predominant producers of annotated tweets, and clients will mostly focus on displaying annotations. Simply because the user experience for third-party services will almost always be more fun than the base information sharing of a twitter client. This is why Foursquare accounts for a hefty chunk of geotagged tweets. Similarly, a user on GoodReads gets cumulative summaries, search, and other features beyond what would be available in most twitter clients. Ultimately though, the reason why there won't be many people manually annotating their tweets is because it runs counter to the reason we joined twitter in the first place: unlike a blog, it's just one simple text entry box, and any additional input (<em>no matter how seamless</em>) will most likely never get used. And so, from here on out, we'll probably see decreasing adoption rates for annotations on twitter.

<strong>Wave 4: Automated Entity Extraction and Aggregation</strong> (<em>9-12 months</em>). So, it's unlikely that many users will manually annotate their tweets in clients (although they may be willing to use third-party sites that will). But what if annotation were mostly automatic? Consider perhaps semantic analysis in the client that watches your typing and presents suggested annotations to be reviewed and deleted below the box the same way Twitter.com suggests your neighborhood. This might increase adoption to some degree, but I remain skeptical. More likely we'll see a larger uptick from the man retweeting bots on twitter when they add semantic analysis and annotations to their bags of tricks. So, the <a href="http://twitter.com/nytwriters">@nytwriters</a> account might retweet and add the annotation <tt>og:organization='The New York Times'</tt> to tweets.

<strong>Final Thoughts</strong> So, what's the ultimate takeaway from this lengthy piece? Mainly, annotations will probably be adopted in distinct waves, with the largest bump in the middle resulting from automated services. And, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/what_twitter_annotations_mean.php">despite some of the hopes to the contrary</a>, annotations will probably be used on a only a very small fraction of tweets, of which the bulk will be from automated services like <a />TwitPic</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, or <a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>. I am not saying annotations will be useless; on the contrary, nothing is more powerful than giving sites with metadata the tools to share them. But like most other forms of media, freeform text (with all of its ambiguities) will always remain predominant in twitter; for instance, if your tools just focus on retrieving tweets annotated <tt>movie:title="Avatar"</tt>, you'll indeed avoid all those tweets about people's twitter avatars, but you'll also miss almost all of the conversation about the movie (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall">the precision/recall curve strikes again</a>).

But, I could be wrong. Thoughts?]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my perennial complaints about the whole "future of journalism" topic is that it seems to be predominated less by people who actually <em>create</em> things and more by people who either come up with trivial ideas that they proclaim will save journalism and those who instead to observe from a remove and discuss what <em>it</em> all means (no, I'm not naming names). Many conferences leave me similarly unenthused. <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/sxsw/on/journalism/">Here are the journalism panels for SXSW this year.</a> And every other week there is another panel on what Wikileaks means for journalism, but <a href="http://meetupnyc.hackshackers.com/events/16183374/">rarely any on how people have used it for journalism.</a> (<em>tasteless self-promotion there</em>).

Which is why I find myself strangely excited to be attending the <a href="http://data.nicar.org/conference/raleigh2011">2011 Computer Assisted Reporting</a> conference this year. For those of you unfamiliar with the term, Computer Assisted Reporting is what database/web journalism was called before it got cool (and before they could put data on the web). And this year there seem to be a surprisingly large number of data journalists I know -- but have never met -- attending. I suppose there will be a little culture clash between the young punks and the old guard, but I also know it'll be a conference full of people discussing <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/car/schedule/">how to do things</a>, and that is what makes me excited.

<em>Are you going to be at the CAR Conference too? If so, please say hi.</em>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently had the honor of speaking at a recent Hacks/Hackers meetup about <a href="http://meetupnyc.hackshackers.com/events/16183374/">working with the Wikileaks data.</a> I talked about some of the work I had done with Sabrina Tavernise and Kevin Quealy looking at the sectarian violence in Baghdad during the occupation. Sabrina's final story <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/middleeast/24surge.html">"Mix Of Trust And Despair Helped Turn Tide In Iraq"</a> is our data-driven look back at the violence, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/10/24/world/1024-surge-graphic.html">A Deadly Day in Baghdad</a> is the graphic we ran alongside it, mapping the violence on both a single day and over the entire course of the occupation.

You can read my slides with their notes here:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://harrisj-share.s3.amazonaws.com/hh_wikileaks.pdf">Reporting Wikileaks</a> (10mb PDF)</li>
</ul>

My talk was organized around three principles of data journalism. These are just three rules that popped into my head while planning the talk out. I am sure there are more than three, and that there are more artful ways to express them, but these three rules articulated the things I think about when working with data. And they helped me explain why I hate <a href="http://wordle.com/">word clouds</a> with a violent passion too. So, what are these rules?

<strong>Find A Narrative.</strong> There is nothing that earns my scorn more than when a site does "data reporting" by just posting a data table without any context or a raw PDF. Word clouds are equally bad. If you want to report on data, you must first find a narrative in it. It doesn't have to be <em>the</em> narrative -- rich data sets have many narratives -- but you need to find at least a narrative. This is essential for several reasons. It allows you to focus your inquiries around a single story and investigate specific questions. It also provides the means for the reader to understand and get more involved. Finally, it gives us ways of narrowing down large data sets to the necessary information to report the story without overwhelming with distractions. Human beings understand the world through narrative; find the narrative if you want to understand your data

<strong>Provide Context.</strong> The other reason why I usually am dismissive of calling raw data dumps journalism is their lack of context. Most data is complex, with its own nuances, jargon, and quirks. This was especially true of the Wikileaks War Logs, which were heavily laden with military jargon and inside information. It became very obvious from the beginning that we would want to to do more to explain these documents and what's happening or we would overwhelm our readers. And so, when charting out the violence in Iraq, we provided some information about why there were concentrations of violence in certain neighborhoods. And when presenting the raw field reports, we worked to add an inline Jargon translator that would help decipher that a LN is a local national or a COP is a combat outpost (<em>my personal favorite bit of inexplicable jargon: A "monica" in Iraq is a <a href="http://mideast.blogs.time.com/2007/06/10/in_love_with_a_car_called_moni/">white Toyota Land Cruiser</a></em>).


<strong>Work The Data.</strong> I always have to laugh at myself when some technology X is declared the savior of journalism. Or when someone writes a script to scrape twitter and declares it investigative journalism. So far, technology has done a far better job of collecting data, but analyzing it still remains very difficult. There is often no magic technology that will figure it out on your own; you're going to have to work with it (<em>I continue to feel everybody should read Brooks' essay <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">"No Silver Bullet"</a> for its notions of accidental complexity and essential complexity</em>). Furthermore, no data is perfect; when working with data, you must be aware of its inherent flaws and limitations. In the case of the Wikileaks data, there were many questions without answers. How much duplication was there in the database? How was the data on civilian homicides collected? Could we definitively say whether the Surge worked or was the decline in violence mainly because there was nobody left to kill and less will to endure the atrocities any longer? Having an idea of the methodology would've helped, but in this data, we didn't even know who was collecting the homicide reports. Were there forces with the responsibility to assemble an accurate record? Or was it all just happenstance? When the killings waned, was it an actual decline in fatalities, or an illusion caused because units were too busy in the Surge to record the violence still happening? Could the leaker have forgotten to copy some records? 

From a journalistic standpoint, this data was troubling. But luckily we had a few things to compare it against. Sabrina Tavernise reported from Baghdad while the sectarian violence raged, so she was able to name neighborhoods where we would expect to see the worst violence. To help out with this, I figured out how to extract MGRS coordinates from the reports and plot them on the map. This gave as a more accurate view of where the homicides were reported, although that too was not perfect (some coordinates did not geocode, and there were 40+ reports that geocoded to Antarctica). To get a feel for duplicates, we picked a single day, and Sabrina read through each homicide report, flagging roughly 20% of the reported deaths as duplicates (and finding cases where fatalities were not counted correctly as KIAs), so we could accurately show the violence of a single day.

On a parallel track, I really wanted to show how the violence rolled across Baghdad's neighborhoods, so I hacked up a Ruby script to output all homicides within a bounding box for Baghdad to a KML file, with a colored circle and count that indicated the numbers of deaths. I added a little extra logic to split up <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/world/iraq-war-logs.html#report/A09843A1-B51C-4E99-C68E03D764C3066E">roundup reports listing bodies found throughout Baghdad</a> into individual points on the map. Finally, I found a map of Baghdad's neighborhoods to use as a background. When the whole timeframe of the data was stepped through as an animation, you could see the violence surge in religiously mixed neighborhoods like Dora and Ghazaliya that Sabrina indicated from first-hand experience was where the worst violence was happening. To confirm we weren't missing any data in the leak, we matched up the weekly homicide chart against the <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22537.pdf">publicly released SIGACTS III</a> numbers to verify the curves looked the same (the counts were larger in the wikileaks data because of duplicates). This data was ultimately used to visualize the year-by-year chart of the violence in the bottom of the graphic.

For the original version of the graphics, Kevin included numbers of civilian deaths for each year. Since each report included a summary table of people wounded and killed, it was only a trivial SQL statement to get body counts for each year in Baghdad. But the exactitude of those numbers implied a certainty that didn't exist. We simply didn't know how much duplication and omission there was in the raw reports, and so we decided to pull the numbers rather than use them (<em>for a more detailed exploration of the new data's limitations, see <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/warlogs/">Iraq Body Count</a> project</em>). Just because it's easy to derive a number from the database doesn't always mean that number is correct. This may all seem academic, when we can just run a query and say "this is what the data contains." But we don't report on data itself. We report on reality, and we must assess how accurate a model of reality the data is.

So yes, it's work to report on data, but it's thrilling work at times. Hopefully, you'll be inspired to work with data yourself.

<strong>Postscript:</strong> I forgot to include <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/visualizing_the_iraq_war_logs.php">an interview with the CJR about the graphic</a> last fall.]]></content:encoded>
